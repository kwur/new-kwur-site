# So, this KWUR 90.3FM's new website

The site was built to replace kwur.com. It currently resides at [kwur.wustl.edu](http://kwur.wustl.edu/).

This site is static, hosted on an S3 instance. It was created using Jekyll (which includes SASS w/ Liquid templating), and features CMS capabilities much like its Wordpress predecessor, courtesy of TinaCMS.

It also taps into the REST API for Spinitron, a playlisting and schedule management application for non-profit radio stations.

Enjoy.
