    <em style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-size: 11px; line-height: 1.4em;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Ruins was made in Aljezur, Portugal in 2011 on a residency set up by Galeria Z&eacute; dos Bois. I recorded everything there except the last song, which I did at mother&rsquo;s house in 2004. I&rsquo;m still surprised by what I wound up with. It was the first time I&rsquo;d sat still for a few years; processed a lot of political anger and emotional garbage. Recorded pretty simply, with a portable 4-track ,Sony stereo mic and an upright piano. When I wasn&rsquo;t recording songs I was hiking several miles to the beach. The path wound through the ruins of several old estates and a small village.</em>

    <span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; The album is a document. A nod to that daily walk. Failed structures. Living in the remains of love. I left the songs the way they came (microwave beep from when power went out after a storm); I hope that the album bears some resemblance to the place that I was in."</em></span>

Since 1996, he has produced a range of audio works for Kranky, Alien8, Mille Plateaux, Room40, Force Inc, Staalplaat, and Fat Cat. His works have been described as "structured ambient", "tectonic color plates" and "cathedral electronic music". More to the point, he has focused on exploring the intersection of noise, dissonance and melody, fostering an approach to songcraft which is both physical and emotive. The New York Times has described his work as "foreboding, abstract pieces in which static and sub-bass rumbles open up around slow moving notes and chords, like fissures in the earth waiting to swallow them whole". His Harmony in Ultraviolet received critical acclaim, including being recognized by Pitchfork as a top recording of 2006. Radio Amor was also recognized as a key recording of 2003 by Wire magazine. His work has also included commissions for contemporary dance, sound-art installations, as well as various writings. He currently resides in Montreal.</span></em></span></span></span>
