We have speakers and DJ equipment of various sizes and types to fit events as large as a club or auditorium (also lazers and fog machines, etc.). For an additional fee, we are happy to come set up the equipment for you and instruct you on how to get familiar with what we have. If you need a DJ, we'd also be happy to come spin KWUR approved jamz tailored to your request. For more information on what equipment we have and availability, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:audioservice@kwur.com">audioservice@kwur.com</a></span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); ">&nbsp;(payment is available through Student Union funds transfer if the customer is a representative of a Wash U. student group).</span>
