  <p>
    Ben and Seb stopped by to play a few tunes and chat for a bit &#8211; check the interview for tidbits on their new album, what they&#8217;ve been up to in the mean time, and them stealing my ideas (you&#8217;ll be hearing from my lawyers, guys). Anyway, it was a great, if short, session as well &#8211; they acousticized the single from their self-titled debut, &#8220;Gold And Warm,&#8221; as well as what will probably be the next single, &#8220;Falling Tide.&#8221; Both are of the utmost sound quality, and as always, you can download everything right here.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=974S1NT6">The whole thing</a><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=GJQRAJH2">Bad Veins &#8211; Gold And Warm (live)</a><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=MM8TFV7F">Bad Veins &#8211; Falling Tide (live)</a></span>
