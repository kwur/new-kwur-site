    Ben and Seb stopped by to play a few tunes and chat for a bit – check the interview for tidbits on their new album, what they’ve been up to in the mean time, and them stealing my ideas (you’ll be hearing from my lawyers, guys). Anyway, it was a great, if short, session as well – they acousticized the single from their self-titled debut, “Gold And Warm,” as well as what will probably be the next single, “Falling Tide.” Both are of the utmost sound quality, and as always, you can download everything right here.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=974S1NT6">The whole thing</a><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=GJQRAJH2">Bad Veins – Gold And Warm (live)</a><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=MM8TFV7F">Bad Veins – Falling Tide (live)</a></span>
