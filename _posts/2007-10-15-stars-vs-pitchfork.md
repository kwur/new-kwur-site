If not: <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/44681-in-our-bedroom-after-the-war"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pitchfork Stars</span></a>. It got a 7.4 – I know that’s what you’re all wondering anyways. Stars apparently wasn’t too pleased with Mr. Ryan Dombol’s opinion, because Torq Campbell responded<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> (<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/stars___/31532.html">Torq’s response</a></span>) vehemently, to say the least. I guess the war’s not quite over for Stars. However, I think most will agree that too much of the consensus regarding indie music is laid upon their smug shoulders. Anyways, Torq seems a bit mad, but isn’t that what pop musicians are supposed to be like?
