    Hey folks, I’m sitting here in the rec gym, getting ready to liveblog the debates from the Media Filing Center, aka “Spin Alley”! I’m surrounded by Germans and Frenchmen. John Oliver from the Daily Show is here, he is the only one making noise in the whole building, everyone is looking at him like he’s a weirdo. We get the live feed, which is pretty sweet, I get to look at Gwen Ifill patiently sitting, which has always been a dream of mine. I’ll send dispatches out every half-hour or so, tune in afterwards when we go live from Spin Alley, with our crack media team.
