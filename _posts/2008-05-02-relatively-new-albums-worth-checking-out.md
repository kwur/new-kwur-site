This is not for you <span style="font-style: italic;">Daydream Nation</span>-only fans. Long-winded instrumental noise-weirdness. The best part is this series is it is actually a series. Each installment has consistent-looking album art. In addition to showcasing Sonic Youth at their most avant-garde, each album <span style="font-style: italic;">looks</span> good together on your shelf. Sadly, this is the first vinyl only release of the series, which may destroy the uniformity of your SYR CD collection. Collect them all! Lee Ranaldo interview I did back in 2006 where we discussed this release coming shortly&#8230;

Is this spelling change a Billy Childish reference/homage? Either way, John Dwyer (The Coachwhips, Yikes, Pink and Brown) and his band deliver yet another solid album. Keep them coming! This band has everything good: Punk, Folk, Experimental, Psychedelic, Soft, Loud, Male Vocals, Female Vocals. And John Dwyer will be happy to know that I think this sounds nothing like the B-52s&#8230;

Mark E. Smith is back with a brand new band (that shouldn&#8217;t be surprising). This is their 27 (or 28th?) studio album. I&#8217;m not sure if it is available in the U.S. yet but I know all you Fall freaks will find a way to get your greasy hands on it. Must. Have. Complete. 28. Album. Discography&#8230;

This 3 disc set features recordings from Chatham&#8217;s recent North American guitar trio tour. Over three hours worth of repetitive dissonant guitar strumming! Included in the recordings: Lee Ranaldo, Alan Licht, Thurston Moore, David Daniell and Tony Conrad. Each performance of the piece at first sounds identical, but those who are patient will be rewarded after each uniquely slow-building climax&#8230;
