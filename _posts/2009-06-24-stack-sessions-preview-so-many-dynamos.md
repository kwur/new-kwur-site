    <span style="font-weight:bold;">UPDATE: due to technical issues (dead keyboard), the in-studio has been post-poned BUT the band will still be in the studio at 4:30 for an interview. We’ll be rescheduling the in-studio for some later date, don’t worry man!</span>

They were originally slated to perform live for your aural pleasure BUT it looks like tragedy has struck in the form of a busted keyboard, so the performance is unconfirmed at the moment. It hasn’t been ruled out entirely yet, but things aren’t looking good – which is a real bummer for the guys, as they’re about to kick off a tour and have a <a href="http://www.myspace.com/somanydynamos">bunch of shows</a> coming up in the next few days. You can follow updates on the situation (whether there’ll be a live performance or not, basically) in REAL TIME on our <a href="http://www.twitter.com/KWUR">Twitter</a> (so lame). In any case, be sure to turn yr radio dial to 90.3 tomorrow!
