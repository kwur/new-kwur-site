  <p>
    Sonic Youth&#8217;s 16th studio album, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Eternal</span>, drops on Tuesday.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Not including the wonderful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Youth_Recordings">SYR series</a>, it&#8217;ll be their first full-length indie label release since 1988&#8217;s now classic <span style="font-style: italic;">Daydream Nation</span> (as recognized by the Library of Congress <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recordings_preserved_in_the_United_States_National_Recording_Registry#2005">National Recording Registry</a>).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you were lucky enough (or really just had the disposable cash-money) to pre-order from Matador, you&#8217;ll get a nifty bonus LP from their free/WFMU sponsored July 4th NYC concert from last summer. It&#8217;s a good one.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And finally, I&#8217;ll be the first to admit this is pretty great:<br />

    Even better: Letterman on 6/10:<br />
