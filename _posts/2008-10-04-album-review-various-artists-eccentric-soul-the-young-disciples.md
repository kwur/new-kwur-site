  <p>
    Eccentric Soul is a series that digs up soul sounds and scenes that are unknown to all but the most intrepid crate diggers. This volume features the Young Disciples label, a late 60s/early 70s soul/funk label from East St. Louis. Some of the session players on the track (drums, bass) are just insane. Overall excellent, interesting compilation that blends Chicago soul, wacked out psychedelic soul and countrified Southern soul.
