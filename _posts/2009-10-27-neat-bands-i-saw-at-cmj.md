  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Boogie Boarder</span> (<a href="http://www.myspace.com/boogieboardertheband">myspace</a>/<a href="http://www.famousclass.com/">website</a>)<br />LISTEN TO: &#8220;Bio Hassle,&#8221; &#8220;USRA&#8221;<br />Their new record &#8211; Pizza Hero &#8211; is tough to describe, but I&#8217;d situate it somewhere between Ponytail and Les Savy Fav &#8211; high energy, barely intelligible lyrics, and sick, sick repetitive riffs. In other words, great stuff. They sound basically the same live, but better, because it&#8217;s louder and right in your face.
  </p>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Darlings</span> (<a href="http://www.myspace.com/darlingsokay">myspace</a>/<a href="http://www.famousclass.com/">website</a>)<br />LISTEN TO: everything on their myspace<br />These cats also had a new record come out over the summer, about a month after Boogie Boarder&#8217;s, on the same label (Famous Class). It packs the same energy, but it focuses it into lo-fi garage pop. Catchy and delicious. Again, similar sound live, but a LOT noisier, more feedback, and guitar-destructive tendencies. We liked &#8217;em so much we saw &#8217;em twice.

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Surfer Blood</span> (<a href="http://www.myspace.com/surferblood">myspace</a>/<a href="http://kaninerecords.com/">website</a>)<br />LISTEN TO: &#8220;Twin Peaks&#8221;<br />Hadn&#8217;t heard Surfer Blood before I went to NYC, but I heard they played something like 15 shows over the course of 4 days. Also, the New York Times (?!) <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/26/arts/music/26cmj.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=surfer%20blood&st=cse">digs them</a>. I do too, a lot &#8211; they play lo-fi pop, but with a lot of attention to good musicianship and a tight live show. These guys have their shit together and they&#8217;re great &#8211; keep an eye out for a record in the next few months. Also, catch them when they open for Japandroids at the Billiken Club. This will be one of the best shows in St. Louis this fall, DO IT.

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jeff the Brotherhood</span> (<a href="http://www.myspace.com/jakeandjamin">myspace</a>/<a href="http://infinitycat.com/wordpress/">website</a>)<br />LISTEN TO: &#8220;Heavy Days,&#8221; &#8220;Heavy Damage,&#8221; &#8220;Bone Jam,&#8221; the whole record<br />Cannot stop listening to &#8220;Heavy Days,&#8221; JtB&#8217;s new record. Armed with just three strings and a drum kit, Jake and Jamin play some serious (metal/stoner/psych/pop) jams, and when they took the floor at Above the Auto Parts Store in Brooklyn-Kings, the entire crowd of unwashed hipsters went fucking crazy. My knees are still pretty banged up from being beaten into the corner of the stage throughout their 45 minute set. If these guys come through town, don&#8217;t miss &#8217;em. Oh yeah, check out <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2009/10/jeff_the_brothe_5.html">Brooklyn Vegan&#8217;s pictures from the show</a> &#8211; you&#8217;ll see what I mean (NSFW).

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sleigh Bells</span> (<a href="http://www.myspace.com/sleighbellsmusic">myspace</a>)<br />LISTEN TO: them live<br />Lo, a new buzz band (apparently) that&#8217;s bound to get a lot of praise from Pitchfork and other hip people who know things about music. In fact, the aforementioned site just named their track &#8220;Crown on the Ground&#8221; Best New Track &#8211; whatever that means &#8211; but heads up, it&#8217;s physically painful to listen to. Not saying awful, just painful. HOWEVER, they put on an awesome live show &#8211; just a chick covering vocal and dancin&#8217; duties, and a dude playing loud, loud, distorted guitar. Think The Kills, or maybe MIA (who was in attendance, with 50 other people, when I saw them).
