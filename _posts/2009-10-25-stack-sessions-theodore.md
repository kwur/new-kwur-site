  <p>
    Last night Justin Kinkel-Schuster – lead-singer and songwriter for local band Theodore – stopped in, played some songs and talked some talk. We discussed his band’s recent label-signing, his recent RFT awards for “best male vocalist” and “best country (alternative),” <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkQr-Lxf1No">George Hamilton IV’s “Abilene”</a>, “high-voiced New Folk heroes,” rock operas, and probably some other things. I’ll be broadcasting the interview live on the airwaves (@90.3 fm/kwur.com) at 7 or 8pm (central time, natch), but if you wanna check out the songs right now, give a listen below. Perhaps most importantly, Theodore will be performing tonight at Off Broadway with Samantha Crain and it promises to be a blockbuster humdinger bonanza mindblower so, you know, keep that in mind. Hopefully we’ll get the full band in the studio some time soon.
