  <p>
    Last night Justin Kinkel-Schuster &#8211; lead-singer and songwriter for local band Theodore &#8211; stopped in, played some songs and talked some talk. We discussed his band&#8217;s recent label-signing, his recent RFT awards for &#8220;best male vocalist&#8221; and &#8220;best country (alternative),&#8221; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkQr-Lxf1No">George Hamilton IV&#8217;s &#8220;Abilene&#8221;</a>, &#8220;high-voiced New Folk heroes,&#8221; rock operas, and probably some other things. I&#8217;ll be broadcasting the interview live on the airwaves (@90.3 fm/kwur.com) at 7 or 8pm (central time, natch), but if you wanna check out the songs right now, give a listen below. Perhaps most importantly, Theodore will be performing tonight at Off Broadway with Samantha Crain and it promises to be a blockbuster humdinger bonanza mindblower so, you know, keep that in mind. Hopefully we&#8217;ll get the full band in the studio some time soon.
