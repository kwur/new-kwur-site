    Hey yaaaaaa&#8217;ll
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Record Store Day is going down tomorrow, and if you live in St. Louis, you might hit up Vintage Vinyl, Apop or Euclid Records for the festivities! Basically, this is a chance to support and celebrate your favorite local record store, and there will be a lot of live music, special RSD-only promos, and free beer (at least at Vintage Vinyl). In any case, check these links for more info, and I better see you there.
