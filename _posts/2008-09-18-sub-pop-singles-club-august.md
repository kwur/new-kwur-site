  <p>
    Recently, everyone&#8217;s favorite Seattle institution, Sub Pop records, re-established their well known singles club to celebrate their 20 anniversary. For $75, 1500 lucky subscribers will receive a special 7inch 45rpm record every month for one year. I&#8217;ll review them all right here on the KWUR Blog.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The now sold out series started in August with our favorite California psychedelic doom band, <span style="font-weight: bold;">OM</span>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Gebel Barkal&#8221; b/w &#8220;(Version)&#8221;</p> 
    
    <p>
      </span><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/Om_Gebel-770640.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 244px; height: 242px;" src="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/Om_Gebel-770605.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>OM formed from the ashes of the rhythm section of stoner rock band, Sleep. Featuring just bass and drums, OM delivers the right mix of heavy slow rhythms and soothing psychedelic chants. This release is the first with new drummer, Emil Amos.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      &#8220;Gebel Barkal&#8221; doesn&#8217;t deviate too much from that formula, which is a good thing &#8211; it&#8217;s perfect for throwing on the turntable for a quick (four minute) light-up.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But, the real jem here is the B-side, &#8220;(Version)&#8221;. &#8220;(Version)&#8221;, quite simply, is a &#8220;dub remix&#8221; of the A-side. The reverb has been turned up slightly, some delay added, and a few fancier drum fills thrown in, for an even smoother psychdelic dub jam.
    </p>

      I have no clue what Sub Pop has in store for September (that&#8217;s part of the fun), but it should be arriving in my mailbox soon. However, we have been promised that within the next 11 releases, we should at least see material from: Unnatural Helpers, Tyvek, Black Mountain, Black Lips, Arthur & Yu, Mika Miko, Blues Control, and Notwist. Of course, some surprises should be in store as well.
