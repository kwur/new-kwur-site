    Hello KWURians,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For our first FIVE SONGS TO LISTEN TO of the spring semester, we reached out to Portland, ME's Falls of Rauros, who've been one of my favorite American black metal bands for several years now. They gave us an aweomse five songs, so check them out below!

    <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="color: rgb(62, 69, 76); line-height: 14.079999923706055px; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247);">Arab Strap – "Fucking Little Bastards" These guys are, to me, unrivaled in their outward projection of self-loathing and a sort of arrogance laced with beauty and dark humor. This song in particular is deafening. </span></span></span>

    <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="color: rgb(62, 69, 76); line-height: 14.079999923706055px; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247);">Six Organs of Admittance – "S/Word and Leviathan" Incredibly tense without letting up. Twelve minutes of immense droning "folk." Even better in sequence with the rest of this album. </span></span></span>

    <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="color: rgb(62, 69, 76); line-height: 14.079999923706055px; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247);">Silver Jews – "Death of An Heir of Sorrows" David Berman is a long-time master of wry alt-country songcraft. This one is very, very sad. </span></span></span>

    <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="color: rgb(62, 69, 76); line-height: 14.079999923706055px; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247);">Julianna Barwick – "One Half" Beautiful. Multi-layered vocal parts woven with strings, synthesizer and guitar. A really gorgeous result. </span></span></span>

Jason passed away about a year ago and is missed wildly.</span></span></span>
