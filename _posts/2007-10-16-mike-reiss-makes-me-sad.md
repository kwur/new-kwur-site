    <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.duffgardens.net/media/guests/character/bergstrom1.gif"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 139px; height: 154px;" src="http://www.duffgardens.net/media/guests/character/bergstrom1.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />Last night, I went to see <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0718514/">Mike Reiss</a> (left, Simpsonized as <a href="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/7F19.html">Mr. Bergstrom</a>, a character voiced by Dustin Hoffman), a long time writer on The Simpsons, speak at Graham Chapel. While he was very funny, it really saddened me that he still thinks The Simpsons is as great as it was during the first few seasons. The show has been a giant cop out over the last few years. I tried to ask him a question about why the show has chosen to resolve long running gags, such as <a href="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/BABF19">the location of Springfield</a> and <a href="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/CABF21">Smithers&#8217; homosexuality</a>, and he looked at me like I was a huge douchebag. Maybe I am, but the show is pretty fucking awful now, and as a loyal fan, the new episodes are now just too painful to watch.
