    Klax here:

    I thought I would start a new “feature” here on the good ‘ol KWUR Blog about new <span style="font-weight: bold;">“Subversive Cinema”</span> DVD releases.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Subversive films “<span style="font-style: italic;">attempt to undermine existing institutions or value systems</span>“. “<span style="font-style: italic;">The subversive attacks something in control and wishes to replace it by what does not yet exist and has as yet no power</span>“. (Amos Vogel – <span style="font-style: italic;">Film as a Subversive Art</span>)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Luckily October features a slew of nice subversive DVD releases, lets check some out…
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Films of Kenneth Anger, Volume 2</span><br />(October 2 – Fantoma Films)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Kenneth Anger is one of the leading American avant-garde filmmakers, who also blew shit up with the publication of <span style="font-style: italic;">Hollywood Babylon</span> which detailed all the juicy gossip of Hollywood pre-1950. These brilliant restorations continue where volume 1 left off. Essential for any basic subversive collection. [Note: <span style="font-style: italic;">Puce Moment</span>, found on Volume 1, was screened during KWUR Week 2007 Movie Night]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Included are Scorpio Rising (1964), Kustom Kar Kommandos (1965), Invocation of My Demon Brother (1969), Rabbit’s Moon (1979 version), Lucifer Rising (1981).
  </p>

  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Battleship Potemkin (1926, Sergei Eisenstein, USSR)<br /></span>(October 23 – Kino International)<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span><br />This is a newly restored 2-disc “ultimate edition” which includes a 5.1 mix of the originally specified score (with a 55 piece orchestra) and restored intertitles. Considered one of the best films of all time (a Film 101 necessity), this film glorifies the story of a 1905 battleship crew who overthrew their oppressive tsarist captains.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">O Lucky Man! (1973, Lindsay Anderson, UK)<br /></span>(October 23 – Warner Home Video)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Another 2-disc “Special Edition” with star Malcolm McDowell (think Clockwork Orange) providing commentary. This film, an “allegory life in a capitalist society” is the sequel to 1969’s If… (also recently released on Criterion).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Breathless (1960, Jean-Luc Goddard, France)<br /></span>(October 23 – Criterion Collection)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Finally one of the most important films of all time (Goddard’s first) gets a proper 2-disc Criterion Collection release. At first look, this films seems rather conventional, which speaks to its influence on modern cinema. The films tells the “irrelevant” story of a French gangster by ingeniously purging all the conventional Hollywood norms.

  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Paradise Now (1970, Marty Topp)<br /></span>(November 1 – Arthur Magazine)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This limited edition DVD (of 1000) is Arthur Magazine’s (now back!) second DVD release, following Ira Cohen’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Invasion of Thunderbolt Pagoda</span>. The film is the definitive document of a 1968 performance by the experimental theatre group “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Theatre">The Living Theatre</a>” in Brussels. [Note: <span style="font-style: italic;">Invasion of Thunderbolt Pagoda </span>was screened during KWUR Week 2007 Movie Night]
  </p>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size:100%;">All these films are mentioned in some way in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Vogel">Amos Vogel’</a>s exhaustive landmark study, <span style="font-style: italic;">Film as a Subversive Art</span> (originally published in 1974 – now back in print!)</span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
