  <p>
    <a href="http://www.myspace.com/femaledemand">Female Demand</a> is a two piece out of Houston, and they play loud loud loud rock and roll music. Like, when we were recording their session, shit-was-falling-out-of-the-ceiling-loud. How do two people make so much noise? While you contemplate that mystery, go ahead and download three tracks below. If the link doesn&#8217;t work or the file won&#8217;t open, leave a comment and I&#8217;ll fix it.<br /><a href="http://www.box.net/shared/phfdrs16s2"><br />Female Demand session</a>

    Oh yeah, I guess we&#8217;re back. More to come, soon.
