  <p>
    There was a time when emo wasn’t such a bad thing. At The Drive-In has the e word listed as one of their styles on allmusic, and Jawbreaker’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Dear You</span> is still a classic. So perhaps it isn’t a surprise that the first RIYL on the one-sheet for Ela’s new CD <span style="font-style: italic;">Real Blood on Fake Trees</span> is Jawbreaker. Ela plays an angular style of emo that doesn’t share much in common with the brand of emo that is currently popular. Ela relies on dark melodies instead of comparing ex-lovers to arms dealers to create an intense disc that doesn’t quite reaches the heights of Jawbreaker, but doesn’t fall to the lows of what emo has come to represent either.
