  <p>
    There was a time when emo wasn&#8217;t such a bad thing. At The Drive-In has the e word listed as one of their styles on allmusic, and Jawbreaker&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">Dear You</span> is still a classic. So perhaps it isn&#8217;t a surprise that the first RIYL on the one-sheet for Ela&#8217;s new CD <span style="font-style: italic;">Real Blood on Fake Trees</span> is Jawbreaker. Ela plays an angular style of emo that doesn&#8217;t share much in common with the brand of emo that is currently popular. Ela relies on dark melodies instead of comparing ex-lovers to arms dealers to create an intense disc that doesn&#8217;t quite reaches the heights of Jawbreaker, but doesn&#8217;t fall to the lows of what emo has come to represent either.
