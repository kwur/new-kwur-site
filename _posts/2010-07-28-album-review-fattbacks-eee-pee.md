Lyrical content ranges from taco stands to dinosaurs, and they are equally diverse in their musical ability. On their new EP cleverly titled “EEE PEE,” they are adept at rip roaring country-rock, blues, and finger blistering straight rock numbers. Guitarist Dave Hagerty and drummer John Joern share the lead vocal duties, but it is Dave’s songs based around goofy lyrics that steal the show. Case in point: Fattback has an “educational” song implying that dinosaurs went extinct due to a blazing hot guitar solo. We also see Fattback’s softer, mellower side on “John Greene,” which pairs banjo and electric guitar solos. All of this adds up to a band of goofy guys who like to play quirky rock music really loudly. That’s just the kind of thing I expect from a bunch of boys from St. Louis.

    Oh, I forgot to mention that when you buy the EP it comes with a few extras that you’ll never be able to download off the internet. The cd comes with an old school cassette tape copy and a temporary dino tattoo! All packaged inside of a pizza box! Pure awesome? Yes.

    Your next chance to see Fattback is at Off Broadway with Deer Tick on August 5.
