Lyrical content ranges from taco stands to dinosaurs, and they are equally diverse in their musical ability. On their new EP cleverly titled &#8220;EEE PEE,&#8221; they are adept at rip roaring country-rock, blues, and finger blistering straight rock numbers. Guitarist Dave Hagerty and drummer John Joern share the lead vocal duties, but it is Dave&#8217;s songs based around goofy lyrics that steal the show. Case in point: Fattback has an &#8220;educational&#8221; song implying that dinosaurs went extinct due to a blazing hot guitar solo. We also see Fattback&#8217;s softer, mellower side on &#8220;John Greene,&#8221; which pairs banjo and electric guitar solos. All of this adds up to a band of goofy guys who like to play quirky rock music really loudly. That&#8217;s just the kind of thing I expect from a bunch of boys from St. Louis.

    Oh, I forgot to mention that when you buy the EP it comes with a few extras that you&#8217;ll never be able to download off the internet. The cd comes with an old school cassette tape copy and a temporary dino tattoo! All packaged inside of a pizza box! Pure awesome? Yes.

    Your next chance to see Fattback is at Off Broadway with Deer Tick on August 5.
