    Ted Leo is the Billy Bragg of the 2000&#8217;s. It&#8217;s a comparison that he doesn&#8217;t seem to like, but an apt one: he&#8217;s the thoughtful punk with a conscience, he&#8217;s content to let his lyrics do all the talking and with his Pharmacists, doesn&#8217;t try to overwhelm the solid musicianship with volume and speed. He does try to branch out on his new album, <span style="font-style: italic;">Living With The Living</span>, but the end result is the same &#8211; another great album. There&#8217;s a lot of the Ted Leo standard of &#8220;thinking man&#8217;s punk,&#8221; but on &#8220;Bomb.Repeat.Bomb&#8221; he sounds more like Dexter Holland of the Offspring &#8211; and it&#8217;s better than you&#8217;d think. His attempt at a reggae-influenced song, &#8220;The Unwanted Things,&#8221; is, unfortunately, not better than you&#8217;d think, but when he takes a stab at a dancier song with &#8220;The Lost Brigade,&#8221; it works, and well.

    That&#8217;s not to say that the old formula isn&#8217;t still a good one. &#8220;Sons of Cain&#8221; is one of the best songs on the album, and &#8220;CIA,&#8221; which is to <span style="font-style: italic;">Living With The Living</span> what &#8220;Where Have All The Rude Boys Gone&#8221; was to <span style="font-style: italic;">Hearts of Oak</span>, is right up there with it. &#8220;Colleen&#8221; is a little slower, but still great, and &#8220;Annunciation Day/Born on Christmas Day&#8221; is faster, but still great. All in all, a simply great album that makes me want to pick up a sign and go protest.
