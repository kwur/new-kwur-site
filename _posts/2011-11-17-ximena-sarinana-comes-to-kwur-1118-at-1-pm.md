    In case you don’t know, Grammy winning Mexican vocalist Ximena Sariñana (hi-MEN-a sa-rin-YAH-na) is coming to the station tomorrow to talk about her self-titled English debut.

    Her latest album “showcase[s] her deep, striking voice, smart, thoughtful lyrics and offbeat personality” with production expertise from Greg Kurstin (Lily Allen, Devo, The Bird and the Bee), Dave Sitek (TV on the Radio, Yeah Yeah Yeahs) and Natalia Lafourcade.

    She has won the Best New Artist Award in the Premios MTV Latinoamerica 2008 (Latin MTV Awards) and received three Latin Grammy Nominations for Best New Artist, Best Alternative Song and Producer of the Year. Her debut album, “Mediocre,” also received a Grammy nomination for Best Latin Rock or Alternative Album. In Mexico, she is a household name. She has appeared in 11 films (among them box office hit Amar Te Duele and film festival winner Dos Abrazos) as well as three prime time telenovelas.
