    The new <a href="http://www.steveearle.com/">Steve Earle</a> record, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Washington-Square-Serenade-Steve-Earle/dp/B000UC1Q9C">Washington Square Serenade</a>, came out yesterday. The album reflects Earle’s recent move to New York City and marriage to <a href="http://www.allisonmoorer.com/">Allison Moorer</a>, who sings harmony on several tracks. It moves away from the outright anger of his last two albums, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Revolution-Starts-Now-Steve-Earle/dp/B0002IQHV6/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-6626378-7878566?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1190901647&sr=1-1">The Revolution Starts Now</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jerusalem-Steve-Earle/dp/B00006GEX6/ref=m_art_li_7/102-6626378-7878566">Jerusalem</a>, towards more restrained protest music, in the vein of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger.
