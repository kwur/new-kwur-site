  <p>
    8:16: The McCain camp just gave me talking points. Lolz.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:16, Palin, Taxes?/Healthcare: Conservatism is patriotic&#8230;she memorized this, I bet&#8230;Gotta say, tapping into the anti-government stuff in the air, good tactics. I don&#8217;t want Paulson doing my co-pay.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:19, Biden, Healthcare: The man can freakin speak, the Scranton stuff doesn&#8217;t sound put on like when Kerry did it&#8230;OMG GAFFE! GAFFE! DID EVERYONE SEE THE GAFFE!&#8230;oh damn, that joke was slick, reporters were laughing
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:21, Biden, Cutbacks: Why do we need to cut foreign aide? It&#8217;s piss-trickle little already&#8230;dodge this question, my friend, dodge like the wind! Generalize as much as possible!&#8230;man, I hate wasteful spending. We should only spend usefully.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:22, Palin, Cutbacks: Yeah, this question is toxic, run away. Americans hate hard choices&#8230;Oh boy, this is full of shit, the CEOs own Alaska. Her mannerisms make watching this downright surreal. Also, the energy plan was a compromise, everyone knows it&#8230;&#8221;How long have I been at this, like five weeks?&#8221; We may have just heard a campaign ender, folks.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:25, Biden, Cutbacks: Shows restraint not pouncing. Nice backhanded compliment about how damn weird Alaska is. Biden is debating better than Obama was.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:26, Ifill, Bankruptcy bill: Biden&#8217;s bankruptcy bill? Gwen Ifill, you are on your shit.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:26, Palin, Bankruptcy bill: if she had any idea what Ifill was talking about, she might actually draw some blood here.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:27, Biden, Bankruptcy Bill: Ifill had to bring it up? Lolz&#8230;obfuscate, my friend. The bottom line is you toughened bankruptcy for the credit card companies in your state, and that meant people couldn&#8217;t pay their mortgages.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:29, Palin, Bankruptcy bill: Wow, she just obviously doesn&#8217;t know what this is. I dunno, I&#8217;m biased, but she is not looking good at all. Not epic fail yet, but close. Love the cutaway to Biden&#8217;s smug closed lip smile.
