  <p>
    9:15, Biden, warm bucket of piss: Interesting response, gently poking at the executive situation over the past eight years.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9:16, Palin, warm bucket of piss: Me and Ifill are doing telepathy right now&#8230;wow, she really doesn&#8217;t know what the VP does. Fuck, she hasn&#8217;t read the Constitution, it seems. I&#8217;m ready to call it now, EPIC FAIL!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9:17, Biden, warm bucket of piss: Wow, this is going to sting. Link her to Cheney. Damn, he hit hard.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9:20, Biden, sorry, got distracted: Wow, he does this common man stuff well, eloquent, even crying? Holy shit!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9:21, Palin, sry: Both sides of the legislature are trying to impeach her, too&#8230;I was in the &#8220;Maverick position&#8221; once, hell of a time getting out of it&#8230;see, both parties suck, so let&#8217;s vote for one of them
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9:23, Biden, maverick: Iluvhim, I luvhim, I luvhim&#8230;Swift boat him! Take apart the maverick.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9:24, Biden, had to change one held view: Thought he was going to do Iraq on this one, surprising. Interesting, using the conservative meme of judicial activism against them.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Losing it, sorry, we&#8217;re getting geared up for spin alley, Giuliani (that&#8217;s mussolini, believe me, boo) is outside, and my Brooklynite blood is boiling.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9:27, Biden: Wow, he is quite eloquent and charming on this kind of thing. Too bad it&#8217;s absolute fluff.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9:28, Palin: Fired people of various political affiliations, too&#8230;Is it gonna be ok?&#8230;Tax-and-spendocrats, will that fly.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9:29, Palin, closing statements: Without the filter? This is without the filter?&#8230;Economic freedom is real popular right now, right?&#8230;the conservative &#8220;isn&#8217;t it great back then&#8221; really does not ring true.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9:30, Biden, closing statements: I wonder where he grew up, he never talks about it, you know?&#8230;&#8221;Work hard and play by the rules&#8221;, winning formula for Dems, at least it used to be.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Alright folks, tune in to the feed, we&#8217;re gonna try and get at these bigs, see you there!
