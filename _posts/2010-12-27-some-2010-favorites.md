    <em>OK folks – a (very) few have been asking, so it's time again for my annual end of year record list… </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>[My <a href="http://kwur.com/some-quick-2010-favorites/">mid-year list</a>, <a href="http://kwur.com/2009-favorites/">2009 list</a>, <a href="http://kwur.com/damn-another-list">2008 list</a>, <a href="http://kwur.com/subversive-cinema-tops-of-2007/">2007 list</a>]</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
     
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>By far, the two albums I listened to most in 2010:</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>The (Royal) Baths – Litanies LP [Woodist]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is dark, brooding, sexy, psychedelica at its best. Debut album featuring Jigmae Baer (ex-Oh Sees, The Perverts) and Jeremy Cox both of the under-rated Tea Elles. There are far too many San Francisco bands on this list, so please start with this one…
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Big Blood – Dead Songs LP [Time Lag]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Excellent husband/wife folk psych duo from Maine. Plus, they give away a ton (all?) of their music on the <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Big_Blood/">Free Music Archive</a>, so you really have no reason not to check them out. If you're into the more drone-y side of things see "Dark Country Magic," which just came out…
  </p>
  
  <p>
     
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>And in no particular order (let's get the San Francisco stuff out of the way first):</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>(Charlie & The) Moonhearts – Moonhearts [Tic Tac Totally]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    These guys finally got a full-length LP out after a batch of solid 7inches and splits. This year, their garage-goodness tops Ty Segall and Thee Oh Sees in my book. Thankfully they're all friends and play together so often that a diagram would be necessary to sort things out
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>White Fence – White Fence LP [Make A Mess]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I spun this one quite a bit in '10 as well. More classic lysergic pop from San Fran, this sounds like it was recorded in 1969 (minus the drum machines)…
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Ty Segall – Melted LP [Goner] </strong>&<strong> San Francisco Rock Compilation or Food or Weird Beer From Microsoft CS [God?]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    "Melted" is another strong release by Ty Segall and "My Sunshine" was definitely a '10 favorite. However, I think "Lemons" is still my favorite Ty LP. On the other hand, this little cassette, "San Francisco Rock Compilation", finds Ty venturing to an even heavier, noisy, experimental audio-collage territory and I like it. I like it a lot.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Thee Oh Sees – Warm Slime LP [In The Red] </strong>&<strong> Quadrospazzed '09 12" [Castle Face]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What would a list be without Thee Oh Sees? I liked "Warm Slime," especially the 10+ minute Side A, which quickly became my summer jam. But to me, it was just not as strong as the back-to-back greatness of "The Master's Bedroom…" and "Help" LPs. But I'll take any Oh Sees I can get and luckily these guys and girl work fast  — there is a new album slated for a spring release on In The Red records.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    "Quadrospazzed '09" came and went quickly but it was a nice little Oh Sees release for us completists. A one-sided 12" 45rpm release featuring a live jam, Side B had only a sprawling etching.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Sword & Sandals – Good and Plenty LP [Empty Cellar]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes, I know, more John Dwyer. But this free-jazz project of his turned out much better than I expected. Worth a mention at least…
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Patrick Mullins – Don't Go To Sleep LP [Yik Yak]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (Relatedly and also worth a quick mention): quite literally, early Oh Sees (OCS) minus John Dwyer
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Various Artists – In A Cloud: New Sounds From San Francisco LP [Secret Seven]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A little compilation which pretty much sums up why the SF scene is awesome: Sonny & The Sunsets, Fresh & Onlys, Thee Oh Sees, Grass Window, Ty Segall, Kelly Stoltz, Donovan Quinn. Check these mostly mediocre cuts, then go seek out further (better) cuts…
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Dan Melchior und das Menace – Visionary Pangs LP</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Blistering scornful garage
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Sun City Girls – Funeral Mariachi LP [Abduction]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This came kind of unexpectedly, a beautiful swan-song for the SCG
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>David Cross – Bigger and Blackerer LP [Sub Pop]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Precautionary tales from Mr. Cross
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Mark Sultan – $ LP [Last Gang]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Noisy doo-wop garage
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>The Fall – Your Future, Our Clutter LP [Domino]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This guy is still doing it and doing it well…
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Pocahaunted – Make It Real LP [Not Not Fun]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Pocahaunted no more. When Best Coast took off, I pretty much <a href="http://kwur.com/some-quick-2010-favorites/">called</a> this one…
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Paul Cary – Ghost of a Man LP [Stankhouse]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I think this may be the most underrated album of the year. More mellowed blues from The Horrors (U.S.) leadman.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Golden Triangle – Double Jointer LP [Hardly Art]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yeah, yeah, yeah. Looking forward to hearing some X-Ray Eyeballs.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Various Artists – Ecstatic Music of the Jemma El Fna LP [Sublime Frequencies]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Blown-out Moroccan street jams
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>TV Buddha – The Golden Period [Trost]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Heavy two-piece Israeli psychedelica
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Tyvek – Nothing Fits [In The Red]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It took me a while to get into these guys' garage-noise, but I dig this way more than their first LP. I think it must have been that horrific artwork on the first LP.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Sex Church – Six Songs By Sex Church [Convulsive]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Garage-Punk + Kraut
  </p>
  
  <p>
     
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>Singles:</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Night Beats – H Bomb 7" [Trouble In Mind]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Baby Dinosaurs vs. The Soft Spots 7" [Die Slaughterhaus]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Various Artists – Their Hispanic Majesties Request 2×7" [Norton]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>A Lost People – Big Booty Bitches digital single [self released]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Drop Z – Tha King of Pop [no label]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
     
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>Vinyl-Geek Reissues/Not New:</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Earth – A Bureaucratic Desire For Extra Capsular Extraction 2xLP [Southern Lord]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This one wins the packaging award this year. Beautiful gatefold with full color printed inner-sleeves, full liner notes, and THICK vinyl (some on clear, even). This early doom drone metal is so good I'm embarrassed I didn't know it before. Kurt Cobain's signature vocal-screams don't hurt on the last track either…
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Amon Duul II – Tanz Der Lemmerage 2xLP</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Krautrock shred masterpiece. Previously a hard one to track down…
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Les Rallizes Denudes – Heavier Than A Death In The Family 2xLP [Phoenix]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Since all this stuff is so blown out I'm not so sure how crucial a vinyl release is, but it's fun to finally have my favorite Japanese band finally on vinyl…
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Various Artists – Alan Lomax Southern Journey 5xLP [Mississippi]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I'm glad these important southern field recordings are available on vinyl. This was a great opportunity to put together a nice little series with excellent artful packaging. Instead Mississippi failed in the art department (unlike them) and opted for fake typewriter font and some lazy photoshop filters. Boo.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Henry Jacobs – Around The World With Henry Jacobs CD [Important]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    "Absurd folklorist Henry Jacobs returns with a selection of rare interviews, odd loops, sales pitches, early<br /> synthesizer demos, an ether-infused evening, and more!" Need I say more?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>The Fall – This Nation's Saving Grace LP </strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Wins the award for cheapest vinyl reissue – I didn't know it was possible to make vinyl so thin. On the other hand, I'm glad to have this without having to pay $30.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>The Mummies – The Mummies Play Their Own Records LP [Estrus]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Man or Astro-Man? – Is it Man or…Astro-Man? LP [Estrus]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Since Estrus isn't putting anything out anymore, at least they've started repressing the good stuff…
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Lou Reed – Metal Machine Music 2xLP [Sister Ray]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NOISE
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Velvet Underground – The Quine Tapes 6xLP box [Sundazed]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Featuring a whole side of Sister Ray recorded at Wash U…
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Spacemen 3 – Perfect Prescription LP & Sound of Confusion LP & Performance LP & Playing With Fire 2×10" & Taking Drugs to Make Music To Take Drugs To 2xLP [Fire & Taang]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    About time this happened. Still waiting for the "Dreamweapon: An Evening of Contemporary Sitar Music" LP though
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Mazzy Star – She Hangs Brightly LP & So Tonight That I May See LP & Among My Swan LP [Plain]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Some of the most beautiful psychedelic music ever recorded
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Sonic Youth – Sister LP</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My favorite Sonic Youth LP, now back in print (and in purple).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Parson Sound – Parson Sound 3xLP Box [Subliminal Sounds]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Stoned 1960s Swedish grooves. Throw this on the table and let it roll. Can't be beat.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>C.C. Hennix – The Electric Harpsichord CD [Die Schachtel]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Praised by La Monte Young and frequently a Henry Flynt collaborator, it's nice to finally see this 1970s material released into the wild.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Various Artists – Excavated Shellac: Strings [Parlortone]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Guitar, oud, violin and more from the 78rpm era. Excellent.
  </p>
  
  <p>
