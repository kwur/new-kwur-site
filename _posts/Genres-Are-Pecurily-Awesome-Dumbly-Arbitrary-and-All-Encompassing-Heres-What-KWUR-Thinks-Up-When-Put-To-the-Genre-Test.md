  Genres Are Pecurily Awesome, Dumbly Arbitrary, and All-Encompassing. Here’s
  What KWUR Thinks Up When Put To the Genre Test

By Katie Lawson and KWUR General Body
    When it was deemed ‘age appropriate’ to read the Hunger Games, aka when I was
twelve, I thought “The Hanging Tree” was the most revolutionary concept ever. Honestly, I still
do. Yes, I’m talking about the dark and haunting folk chant featured in the Mockingjay: Part One
soundtrack and novel. Was I disturbed by the imagery? Yes. Did I listen on repeat as I read the
series for a second time? Of course.
    But what compelled me about the song was the fact Suzanne Collins, the writer of the
Hunger Games series, wrote it specifically for her series. At first, its eeriness and poignant
imagery, as well as its folk style, made me feel the song had been around for much longer. I
imagined it was only known by those in forgotten places, sung at times when the mourning was
thick as the humidity. The fact I somehow had never encountered the tale of a lone tree with a
dark past and a triumphant future by those who sing about its cruelty, made me angry:
obviously, I had missed something in history class.
    But nope. Suzanne Collins made it up, and her invention creates a whole mythology and
history through this small detail, adding a necessary layer to both her novels and the movie.
Such a song makes me geek out, yet again, over the genius of Collins’ work even more. “The
Hanging Tree” roots the novels. Panem transforms into a place Americans can find horribly
familiar, while not completely isolating the rest of the world. Its specificity is just general enough,
the universalism still rings out with the notes. Achieving that balance in a work of science fiction
made for young adults shows the talent of Collins.
    The song hit the airwaves big time upon the movie's release. Jennifer Lawerence is no
singer, but the simplicity of her vocals and the reverence in tone make it a point of nostalgia for
our generation as we grow older. I remember hearing Lawerence on the radio and it was a very
serious matter. People wanted to listen.
    Upon the release of the new Hunger Games Prequal, I began thinking about the strange
nature of “The Hanging Tree” and whether there were other songs like it. Songs that are not
made for the arena of music, but for some other form. I’ve asked KWUR DJs about their favorite
song made for a movie, TV show, video game, musical, or book.

  Fernando wants listeners to pay particular attention to the needle drop in “Across 11th Street”. It
  works perfectly with the movie and is always a great moment to listen to on its own.

  ● Alice Foppiani Senior/Snack Time on Tuesdays at 8:00 PM
  Now, Alice’s answer technically does not fit into the genre of songs made specifically for a
  movie, tv show, or other piece of media. What makes this song unique is the fact this song and
  Abba as a whole inspired many pieces of media. In this case, genre is subverted, and such an
  opportunity should not be given up.

  Merrin felt very passionately about the prompt. Stating, “Gosh darn it the entire Black Panther
  soundtrack exists.” You can’t disagree with a point like that. Merrin felt compelled to give
  another, more explicit answer anyways, and for that, we salute her.

  As a jazz nut, Carson loves older works, especially Hitchcock's filmography. He almost went on
  a rant on the work of this particular composer before composing himself. Saying, “Opening
  numbers of old film soundtracks pop the fuck off”

  Maeve couldn’t remember how to pronounce Sufjan Steven’s name, making one of her picks

  settled.
