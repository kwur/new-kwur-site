  <p>
    The debut CD for the SnowLeopards, aptly titled <span style="font-style: italic;">Debut<span style="font-style: italic;">, </span></span>is very close to being just a generic piece of power-pop. What separates it from the rest of the pack is a retro vibe that permeates throughout the album, especially on &#8220;I&#8217;m on Fire&#8221; and &#8220;Hipmatize Me&#8221; (which may be one of the worst names for a song I&#8217;ve heard all year). With female vocals also, <span style="font-style: italic;">Debut</span> isn&#8217;t going to win the SnowLeopards the amount of fame that a debut such as that of the Arctic Monkeys garnered, but it could wind up being either a good guilty pleasure or a building block to successful second album &#8211; would that be named <span style="font-style: italic;">2</span>?
