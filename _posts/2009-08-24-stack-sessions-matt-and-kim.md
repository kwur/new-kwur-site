    Sat down with Matt and Kim before last night’s sold out show at Off Broadway (Stack Sessions alumni Gentleman Auction House opened) and chatted about their VMA nominated video, what it’s like to be huge now, and life on the tour bus. For as much fun as it was (and believe me, it was a lot of fun), the duo also offered an interesting and well-spoken take on their fame and appearances in various commercials. Oh, also, it looks like Ben Allen will be producing their next album (he produced “Merriweather Post Pavilion” and Gnarls Barkley’s last). Exciting!

    Also, I think we’re going to start publishing interviews in text form. Thoughts on this?
