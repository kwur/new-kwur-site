    Sat down with Matt and Kim before last night&#8217;s sold out show at Off Broadway (Stack Sessions alumni Gentleman Auction House opened) and chatted about their VMA nominated video, what it&#8217;s like to be huge now, and life on the tour bus. For as much fun as it was (and believe me, it was a lot of fun), the duo also offered an interesting and well-spoken take on their fame and appearances in various commercials. Oh, also, it looks like Ben Allen will be producing their next album (he produced &#8220;Merriweather Post Pavilion&#8221; and Gnarls Barkley&#8217;s last). Exciting!

If you missed it, you might have missed one of this year&#8217;s best concerts.

    Also, I think we&#8217;re going to start publishing interviews in text form. Thoughts on this?
