    Okay so we&#8217;re digitizing a bunch of old taped interviews from way back when college radio was important (8/12/86, to be exact), and came across this, uh, gem. It&#8217;s an audio snippet from an interview we did with The Descendents: two DJs try to get Milo to give a station ID, and he gets creative. A fascinating conversation ensues. Enjoy:
