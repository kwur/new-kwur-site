With just drums and guitar they play a mixture of blues, honky tonk, and rockabilly. Their debut album “The Epic Battle of Good and Evil” hits a lot of different styles ranging from rocking Black Keys-esque blues to weird distorted country that might come from Hank Williams on acid. They even have a great little song about driving down Hwy 55 smoking reefer and drinking 40’s. Don’t miss them live because they give a great live show with gritty guitar licks from John Randall and plenty of ridiculous falsetto harmonies from drummer Andy Rehm.

    See them live June 10 at the Firebird or July 10 at Off Broadway for the 2nd Annual Great Crawfish Boil.
