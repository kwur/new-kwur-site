    We’re very excited to announce our annual KWUR Week, where we bring new and diverse artists to the Wash U campus and the St. Louis community. This year we’re proud to present some of our favorite artists: Tycho, Tim Hecker, the Los Angeles Piano Quartet, and for our flagship show we’re bringing Grouper to St. Louis for the first time for one of her only solo shows this year.
