    We&rsquo;re very excited to announce our annual KWUR Week, where we bring new and diverse artists to the Wash U campus and the St. Louis community. This year we&rsquo;re proud to present some of our favorite artists: Tycho, Tim Hecker, the Los Angeles Piano Quartet, and for our flagship show we&rsquo;re bringing Grouper to St. Louis for the first time for one of her only solo shows this year.&nbsp;
