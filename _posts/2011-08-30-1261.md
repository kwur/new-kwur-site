    Hey!

    This past Sunday, classical music director George Yeh received some much deserved recognition in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

    George, who you will notice is perhaps this humble blog's most regular contributor, not only curates an excellent collection of classical music and provides three hours of weekly local classical programming here at KWUR, but is also an avid supporter of classical music all around St. Louis &#8212; rarely do I attend an SLSO performance without seeing his face in the crowd. &nbsp;
