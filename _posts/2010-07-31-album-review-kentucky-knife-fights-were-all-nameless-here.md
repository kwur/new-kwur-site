With the release of their second LP <span style="font-style:italic;">We’re All Nameless Here</span>, KKF shows themselves to be the rock n’ roll force that it deserves to be. Neither on their new album nor in their live show do KKF mess around. They get straight to the music with amped-up rockers and slow burning blues.

    The whole band revolves around Jason Holler’s gravelly voice that frequently stretches to its tremulous limits. Holler keys in to the rest of the Knife Fight, providing an incredibly dynamic sound. Besides ripping guitar solos, the music has nice accents from occasional banjo and blues harp, which thankfully takes cues more from Mick Jagger than John Popper.

    Besides the blues garage rock that sometimes teeters on the edge of punk, this new album also features some grooving, slower numbers. KKF even touches on gypsy romps on “Always a Bride, Never a Bribe” with the help of the Monads’ Matt Shivelbine on fiddle.
