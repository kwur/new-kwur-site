He was 86. An influence on subversive comic artists like R. Crumb and Daniel Clowes, Elder &#8220;could render anything he could see with the precision of a photograph,&#8221; writes David Hajdu in his new book <i>The Ten-Cent Plague: The Great Comic-Book Scare and How It Changed America,</i> &#8220;yet he had no inclination to waste his time on anything other than his overriding interest, pranksterism.&#8221; Inducted into the Comic Book Hall Of Fame in 2003, Elder also worked for E.C. Comics and Playboy, who published his Little Annie Fanny comics for more than 25 years.&#8221; -The AVClub
