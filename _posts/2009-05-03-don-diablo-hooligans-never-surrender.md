  <p>
    This is by far his best single, which is a big departure from this usual &#8216;popped collar&#8217; music that&#8217;s kinda douchy with bad backup dancers. Instead, he gives us a police riot, giant luchadors and something that looks like its out of a Chinese Dia De Los Muertos celebration. However, I give him credit for doing so much work as a clearly self-financed guy. On early comments from people saying this video would be super violent, <span>&#8221;I think this video gives a good representation of what goes on in my head when I am asleep, it&#8217;s like a drug free LSD trip for pros. Welcome to the future!&#8221;<br /></span><br />
