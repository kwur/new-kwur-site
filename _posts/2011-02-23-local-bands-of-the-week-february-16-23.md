    And while I'm doling out well-earned props, I'd like to call attention to acclaimed blues trio Rum Drum Ramblers, who are playing a record release show at Off Broadway on Thursday, February 24 with Carbondale's own punkgrass outfit Whistle Pigs. Fans of Pokey LaFarge will be especially interested in checking out the showâ€“Rum Drum and the South City Three share harmonica and bass talent. You should go!
