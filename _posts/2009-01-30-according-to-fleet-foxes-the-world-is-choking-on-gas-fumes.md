    Addressing rumors that Fleet Foxes had signed to Virgin Records, Robin Pecknold softly explained, &#8220;Fleet Foxes will never, ever, under no circumstances, from now until the world chokes on gas fumes, sign to a major label. This includes all subsidiaries or permutations thereunder. Till we die.&#8221; Fleet Foxes are signed to Sub Pop Records. Warner has owned 49% of Sub Pop since 1995. Warner is a major label.
