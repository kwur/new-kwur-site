Hard to know how to judge soul revival records, since even the best records mostly aim at imitation. But Reed&#8217;s at least cribbing from the right people, and doing a good job of it, too. He goes for the James Brown shrieks and can&#8217;t quite make it, which almost makes it better. Good record, sincere, soulful record, do play.

    Play: 1+++(Yeah!). 3+ (see: Wilson Pickett), 4++, 6+++(lovely ballad, sweet bass), 8, 10++(he does these ballads really well)
