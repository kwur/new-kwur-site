    <span style="font-weight:bold;">JIMMIE DALE GILMORE – SPINNING AROUND THE SUN </span><br />jimmie&#8217;s got one of the best voices out there<br />though I confess it&#8217;s probably a love it/hate it kind of thing<br />very distinct, instantly recognizable pinched, warbly drawl<br />jimmie&#8217;s from lubbock (like his compadres joe ely + butch hancock)<br />and you can just about hear the huge sky and wide open spaces in his big spare songs and the dryness of his singing<br />AFTER AWHILE is the critical favorite and best showcase for his writing (we have this too)<br />but as far as introductions go, I think this album does a fairly good job, emphasizing his considerable skill as an interpreter<br />because of this, it is less far-out new agey than some of his albums but also maybe a bit too straight-laced (nit-picking now)<br />he can even get away with singing a standard like “I&#8217;m so lonesome, I could cry”<br />if you hear these songs and his voice hits you right, it will hit you hard and you will never forget it

    <span style="font-weight:bold;">MERLE HAGGARD – SAME TRAIN, A DIFFERENT TIME</span><br />if you are truly new to country music (which is okay, really)<br />then you might not be familiar with merle&#8217;s songs <br />everyone else should know at least a couple<br />over-sung in karaoke bars across the country<br />lyrics of pro-vietnam war anthems, for instance, making liberal kids across the country wince and cringe <br />merle&#8217;s a great craftsmen as far as writing goes – he&#8217;s written in just about every popular country style since the early 60&#8217;s (for instance, he just released a bluegrass album a couple years back)<br />suitably, he&#8217;s got a range of singing styles, with his catchy pop numbers calling for a different sort of articulation, as you might expect, than his slower ballads, bakersfield and traditionalist stuff<br />this album (1969) is merle&#8217;s ode to jimmie rodgers (see: jimmie rodgers), the first hero of country music <br />all of the songs on here were ones jimmie sang<br />and though he does not try to emulate jimmie&#8217;s style, he makes some nods in that direction<br />for instance, I think it would be hard to find many other instances when merle haggard yodels<br />the instrumentation nods more to jimmie&#8217;s final recordings than his famous solo acoustic 1927 ones<br />and as such feature lovely, hokum-y, dixieland arrangements, full of dobro and horn flourishes<br />wonderful versions of “jimmie&#8217;s texas blues,” and “peach picking time down in georgia” to get you started<br />

    <span style="font-weight:bold;">HILLBILLY JAZZ</span><br />lovely, low-key affair, the debut release (way back in 1974) on the mighty flying fish label<br />western swing revival, featuring famous jazz fiddler vassar clements<br />tight group covers the bases with requisite bob wills, spade cooley, et cetera numbers<br />take a lot of liberties with the standard pop swing sound of, say, the aging 1970s texas playboys, working toward an honest, jazz-based expression using country songs as heads (basically)<br />an influential album, I recommend this to all sorts of dj&#8217;s

    <span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />ROSCOE HOLCOMB – AN UNTAMED SENSE OF CONTROL</span><br />it is really difficult to describe this man&#8217;s music, even for far more articulate folk than myself<br />these songs are really weird<br />and also really intense in a way that is easier heard than described (cop out?)<br />the year he learne d to play banjo, he learned 400 tunes and considered it a gift from god<br />he moans, accompanying himself with banjo, harmonica and a guitar he would fret with a knife<br />a lot of the songs are standards, but many of them do not sound standard when he sings them<br />
