    First ever KWUR Classical post (so please be kind). As part of the WU Assembly Series, David Robertson, the new conductor of the St. Louis Symphony, will be speaking on Wednesday, Sept. 20 at Graham Chapel at 4 PM.

    He is an excellent and very enthusiastic speaker, and a really approachable guy. So if you have time that afternoon, I highly recommend checking him out.

    In addition, Wash U has some tickets to give away for the “Sound Check Preview” concert of the SLSO’s opening weekend, on Thursday, Sept. 21:

    “WU students: Free Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra tickets are available for a September 21, 2006 performance. Call 935-5994 for additional information.”

    If you can’t get these free tickets, all tickets for that Thursday 9/21 concert are $10, every seat in the house. If you’ve never been to the Symphony, this is a great intro to them. This is the music on the program:
