  <p>
    8:30, Palin, Climate Change: How can you not argue about the causes and argue only about the solutions? &#8220;Give those fuckers sandbags&#8221;? If you&#8217;re getting slowly stabbed to death, do you say, &#8220;hey, let&#8217;s not argue about the causes?&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:32, Biden, Climate Change: Biden is a really tuned-in debater, check out that nice little &#8220;difference&#8221; move&#8230;way to make McCain look dumb, say drill, drill, drill with such disdain.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:34, Palin, Climate change: Environmentally friendly drilling, yeah? Also, thanks, cheerleader mom, for making sure we get the cheer right. She&#8217;s doing ok here though, bamboozling sufficiently.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:35, Biden, Climate change: Sure he&#8217;s lying about this clean coal stuff, sure the people at home are sure too. &#8220;Twenty times against alternative energy?&#8221; Eh, weak.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:36, Biden, gay marriage: Stumbled a bit by telling independent bigots that he&#8217;ll let gays kiss up on each other, but got to the hospital stuff, which is the meat of the issue.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:37, Palin, gay marriage: She&#8217;s home here, very comfortable, answer is really well shaped. Should reassure some socially liberal independents, but I wonder if people even care about this stuff (besides the christ kooks), when the economy is in the shitter.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:39, Biden, gay marriage: No nuance, so no, and then nuance nuance nuance. Niiice.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:39, Palin, Iraq: She&#8217;s got this beauty queen bearing, looking straight at the camera that just comes off as weird. Nice on using Biden&#8217;s own words. Ex-DJ Claire: &#8220;When Joe Biden smiles, I feel unsafe.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:41, Biden, Iraq: &#8220;With all due respect, I didn&#8217;t hear a plan&#8221; and just a bit of bite? Too much bite? The media shall decide. Either a good line or Biden&#8217;s a meanie poopoo head&#8230;&#8221;We will end this war. For John McCain, there is no end to this war?&#8221; Nice, that&#8217;ll echo.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:42, Palin, Iraq: Clearly thrown off guard, &#8220;white flag of surrender&#8221;?, Biden&#8217;s gotta answer back&#8230;this attack on Biden personally draws blood&#8230;wow, pitbull time.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:44, Biden, Iraq: See what I mean, senate record cancels out senate record. Overall weak reply, the same talking points.
