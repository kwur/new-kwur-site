    Pitchfork Media overhypes pretty shitty bands and ignores lots of great music. But sometimes, they get it right.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “According to <a href="http://wearemanman.com/" target="_blank"><b>Man Man</b></a>‘s <a href="http://myspace.com/wearemanman" target="_blank"><b>MySpace</b></a>, the follow-up to <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/20222/Man_Man_Six_Demon_Bag"><b><i>Six Demon Bag</i></b></a> is “well underway,” and they’re currently recording in Chicago.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The band will take a break from recording to hit the road this Spring. And when Man Man tour, they tour hard. The dates they have scheduled start March 15 and don’t let up until April 15.

    There’s also a one-off show this weekend in St. Louis.”
