    Pitchfork Media overhypes pretty shitty bands and ignores lots of great music. But sometimes, they get it right.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;According to <a href="http://wearemanman.com/" target="_blank"><b>Man Man</b></a>&#8216;s <a href="http://myspace.com/wearemanman" target="_blank"><b>MySpace</b></a>, the follow-up to <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/20222/Man_Man_Six_Demon_Bag"><b><i>Six Demon Bag</i></b></a> is &#8220;well underway,&#8221; and they&#8217;re currently recording in Chicago.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The band will take a break from recording to hit the road this Spring. And when Man Man tour, they tour hard. The dates they have scheduled start March 15 and don&#8217;t let up until April 15.

  <p>
    There&#8217;s also a one-off show this weekend in St. Louis.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Dates: 02-24 St. Louis, MO &#8211; The Gargoyle (Washington University)
