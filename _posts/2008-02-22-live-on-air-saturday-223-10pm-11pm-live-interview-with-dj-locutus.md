  <p>
    That’s right everyone, I’ll be hosting a special show on KWUR.com or KWUR 90.3 FM (if you’re near U. City) with St. Louis’s own DJ Locutus, live in Studio.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Residing in St. Louis, Locutus almost exclusively DJ’s internationally in Europe and abroad. He’ll be playing in the place we all call home for the first time in ages, at I’m So Techno on Saturday, March 8 at Mercury (1025 Spruce St., STL) all for the magical price of $5.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I’ll be doing my best Charlie Rose/Anderson Cooper impression, and interviewing the man about DJ’ing here and abroad, his production work, DJ’ing as a postmodern art, and how he got to where he was.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you can’t get to it, I’ll be recording it, and the podcast will be posted on the kwur.com blog.

    peace all, <br />brian.<br />DJ Meatface<br />Director of Electronic Music – KWUR 90.3 FM

    Oh yeah, here’s a bio:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Locutus has been championing the sounds of American techno both in the reemerging American dance scene and while performing extensively in Asia and Europe. His renowned DJ skills have been witnessed at the finest clubs, festival, and events around the world. Rather than pigeonholing himself like many DJs today, his sets blend a range of funky styles form house, techouse, electro, minimal, and of course techno. He brings back meaning to the word “mix”. He has recently put out prominent EPs for Ignition Technician’s DJ Special Needs, and was on remix duties for Notorius North. In addition he has highly acclaimed and charted releases on his own labels Bipolar and Polarized, and other international labels such as Konsequent, Surface, Tensionworks, Serie, Illtown, Ber Knuckle, Remains, Dark Print, Anode, Elypsia, and Azure. Not only has Locutus been able to share the decks and studio with some of the giants of techno, but it is commonplace to see his vinyl releases in the boxes of top jocks like: Ben Sims, Adam Beyer, Henry Chow, Chris Finke, Ignition Technician, Adam Jay, Dave Clarke, Suburban Knight, Sven Vath, Marco Bailey, Angel Molina, Frankie Bones, DJ Surgeon and others.
