With the addition of bass and drums, her sound has matured considerably from her last EP. Expect tight bass lines, smooth drumming, and soaring vocals on every song. On “Not the World” the group proves they can do rocking pop songs as well as they can do mellow organ-driven numbers like “Beautiful You.” The instrumentation plays beautifully, but it is still the arching vocal that captures your attention on each song. I understand Beth and Co are working on a new full length, so keep an eye out for that in the coming year.

    Your next chance to see Beth Bombara and the Robotic Foundation live is on September 17 at the Map Room in St. Louis.
