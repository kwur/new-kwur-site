    Bruce Conner is most famous for his experimental &#8220;found film&#8221;, <span style="font-style: italic;">A Movie</span> (1958). In <span style="font-style: italic;">A Movie</span>, Conner edited together stock footage, news reels, Academy countdown leader, and B-Grade films (among other things) to create a &#8220;pessimistic comedy on the human condition&#8221;. The result is an entirely original film made from entirely unoriginal sources.

    Similarly, in 1978, Conner collaborated with DEVO to create their second music video, &#8220;Mongoloid&#8221;. DEVO described it as, &#8220;a documentary film <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>exploring the manner in which a determined young man overcame a basic mental defect and became a useful member of society. Insightful editing techniques reveal the dreams, ideals and problems that face a large segment of the American male population.&#8221; What results is a brilliant three and a half minute music video by the master of the &#8220;found film&#8221;.
