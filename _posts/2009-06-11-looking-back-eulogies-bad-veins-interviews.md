    A couple of months ago, then-promotions director Amanda and I sat down and had a conversation with Eulogies and Bad Veins when they came through town. We recorded both interviews and, like many interviews with KWUR (coughNirvanacough), they sat on a dusty hard drive (mine) for months before someone (me) even thought about letting them see the light of day. My laziness aside, I finally got around to editing the audio and now present them to you, faithful readers, for your listening pleasure:

    We and guitarist/vocalist Peter Walker discuss their new record &#8220;Here Anonymous,&#8221; the Twitter phenomenon, and Scrabble. Also he tells us we are great, and we return the compliment.

    Ben, Sebastien, Amanda and I discuss just about everything. Highlights include: how they&#8217;re going to name the new record, crazy shows, and their invention company.

    (both interviews took place at an Imo&#8217;s, hence the background noise).

    ((oh yeah, I&#8217;m sitting on a bunch of other interviews &#8211; Vivian Girls, Cut Off Your Hands, Meat Puppets &#8211; which I want to get out soon. I won&#8217;t promise anything because if I do it&#8217;ll probably never get done. But keep your eyes peeled))
