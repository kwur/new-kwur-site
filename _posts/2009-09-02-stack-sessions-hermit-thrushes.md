    I&#8217;ve had a lot of fun doing these Stack Sessions; it&#8217;s always interesting to meet the musicians behind the records you like and listen to regularly. When Hermit Thrushes were confirmed to come in, I was excited &#8211; they play a messy but intricately fashioned take on noise rock, and I looked forward to hearing how it would translate live. Unfortunately the show was canceled, but they agreed to come in and play on air anyway. They pulled up in a huge van, something like what airports use to shuttle people between parking lots and the terminal, and out came 8 or 9 people. If you&#8217;ve been in the station, you know that we&#8217;re a little tight on space, and I was concerned about fitting everyone in. They weren&#8217;t &#8211; in fact, they <span style="font-style: italic;">insisted</span> on cramming the entire band (and the various hitch-hikers they&#8217;d picked up along the way) into the old recording studio, probably one of the smaller rooms in the station. What followed was the most insane, wild and entertaining in-studio to date. No listenable audio of the music they played survived. All that&#8217;s left are pictures and an interview, which are presented, in rough chronological order, below.

    8 naked, sweaty people, crammed into a 10&#215;10 room with their instruments, equipment, mic stands and piles of accumulated station crap, playing loud fucking rock and roll &#8211; this is what college radio means to me.
