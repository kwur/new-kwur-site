    This Video is ruling my life right now. I find it mind-distorting, in that it’s completely catchy, but I can’t for the life of me remember any of the words for more than a second. The lyrics are in pseudo-english, and this enrages the relevant parts of my brain, which want desperately to understand what this man is saying. This, combined with a healthy beat and pleasing horn part, makes this song capable of anything it sets its mind to.
