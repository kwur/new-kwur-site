  <p>
    Time for another round of concert selections, running from now until mid-April.&nbsp; I'll follow this one up shortly with another that deals specifically with April 21st &#8211; 24th, which is basically the best concurrent four days of concerts I've seen since I've come to St. Louis.&nbsp; Anyway, this Show Selector is dedicated mostly to garage rock, because I fucking love garage rock and there's a ton of it coming our way.&nbsp; More after the jump.

    <strong>March 31st: Ty Segall w/ Flight &#8211; The Gargoyle [<a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/event.php?eid=111268642284588">event info</a>]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I've been all over the Gargoyle this semester, but, like, they're consistently bringing excellent shows to campus (JEFF, Dan Deacon, Menomena, anyone?).&nbsp; Anyway, I caught <a href="http://www.myspace.com/tysegall">Ty Segall</a> in Nashville a few weeks ago, and it was one of the rowdiest shows I've ever been to: people crowd surfing on top of people crowd surfing, beer everywhere and on everything, Ty fighting the crowd with a bar stool (as pictured above).&nbsp; So you can't drink in the Gargoyle and it's hard to crowd surf, but whatever, get drunk beforehand if that's your thing and come bang your head.&nbsp; Also, rumor has it that this will be a rare solo show; he used to play everything himself but now plays with a backing band, so this is a rare opportunity.&nbsp;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.myspace.com/inflighttunes">Flight</a>, a newish band from Mississippi that plays real wobbly, crunchy rock and roll with a twist of Jesus and Mary Chain, are opening.&nbsp; If you like Wavves (earlier stuff), come early and catch Flight, because they're better in my opinion.

    <strong>April 1st: Pokey LaFarge and the South City Three (Record release) &#8211; Off Broadway [<a href="http://www.offbroadwaystl.com/">event info</a>]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Recent KWUR Week alumni <a href="http://www.pokeylafarge.net/">Pokey and his South City Three</a> are playing a show to celebrate the release of their Jack White-produced 7", out now on Third Man Records.&nbsp; This show kind of speaks for itself, but in case you've not heard of Pokey, he plays Riverboat Soul, which is a mix of "early jazz, string ragtime, country blues and western swing."&nbsp; Live, this translates to a foot-stomping, enthralling and often-hilarious time.&nbsp;
  </p>

    <strong>April 17th: Bass Drum Of Death &#8211; The Firebird [<a href="http://www.firebirdstl.com/event/34755/">event info</a>]</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Another killer band from Mississippi, very much in the vein of Flight but a little less lo-fi and grunge/a little more Ty Segall or Black Lips-style snottiness.&nbsp; Trax posted to myspace indicate that I will likely enjoy seeing <a href="http://www.myspace.com/johnbarrettmusic">Bass Drum of Death</a> live, and if it's your thing, you might too.&nbsp; Also, is there something going on in Mississippi rock'n'roll-wise that I'm missing out on, or is it simply a coincidence that there are two awesome MS bands coming to town right on each others' heels?

    <strong>April 19th: The Fresh & Onlys w/ Crocodiles &#8211; The Billiken Club</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jesus, how much garage rock can we fit into a few weeks?&nbsp; Actually, to be fair, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thefreshonlys">The Fresh & Onlys</a> have veered more toward psych-pop on their newest record, "Play It Strange," and the shift sounds real good.&nbsp; Here's to hoping it translates well to the stage, but I'm guessing that it does, seeing how they're playing the massive Primavera Festival in May.&nbsp; Also, the West Coast &#8211; specifically, S.F. &#8211; has got it going on (Ty Segall, Thee Oh Sees, TF&O's, Sic Alps, many others), and it's nice to see some of these bands hitting up the Midwest.&nbsp; I've seen <a href="http://www.myspace.com/crocodilescrocodilescrocodiles">Crocodiles</a> here once before, and it was a disastrous show (but a fun interview).&nbsp; I'm going to give it another shot because I enjoy their records, and everyone deserves a second chance.
