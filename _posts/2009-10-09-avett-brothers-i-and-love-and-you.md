    Well,for a band that sings so much about breaking hearts, they sure waited long enough to break mine. No more of that raucous energy I loved about them&#8230; downplaying banjo and guitar in favor of piano. No more of those harmonies that make you feel like crying and laughing at the same time. Well-produced and some tracks are very pretty. I wish them luck wooing a wider audience, I just wish it didn&#8217;t come at the cost of what made me love them&#8230; that intimate feel, a little edginess, the sense of being on the edge of falling apart (a la the better Replacements albums). An album of very <span style="font-weight: bold;">pretty</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">well-crafted</span> PIANO MUSIC.<br />Thanks, Rick Rubin. Goodbye, North Carolina, Hello Brooklyn.

    Harmonies have gotten broader and poppier, less high-off-lonesome (IE, less bluegrass).<br />All pretty Midtempo.

    1. Pretty piano ballad. Title track.<br />2. great! banjo and longing and sweet melody. what they do best! tender love.<br />3. piano, bruce springsteen<br />4, 6. a little looser, guitar, a little bit of scott avett yelling<br />5. rolling stone says this song is &#8220;mature.&#8221; Really good part in the middle where&#8230;<br />no, wait, this is MTV pop-rock.<br />7. yeah! Fun and goofy, still piano though.<br />10. UGH! CMT crap.<br />11. good! goofy stop-and-start
