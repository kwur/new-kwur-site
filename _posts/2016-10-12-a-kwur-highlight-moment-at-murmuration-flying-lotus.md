    To say that Flying Lotus at Murmuration Fest was an out-of-body experience is an understatement. The concert began with a screen in front of the stage that presented his ‘You’re Dead’ tour visuals. All that was visible from Flying Lotus was his silhouette behind the fast-paced, enchanting animations depicting the afterlife. The animations began with the screen flashing, alternating between red and white, effectively making the screen a strobe light of sorts. Suddenly, “YOU’RE DEAD” text—in reference to his album released in 2014—appears. All the while, FlyLo is delivering head-pounding beats that got the crowd uncontrollably tripped out. The rest of the visuals were inter-weavings of various images which were the original work of Shintaro Kago, animated by Strangeloop.<br /> The visuals were surreal and graphic, which accompanied by FlyLo’s production, were meant to take the viewer along a psychological journey through the afterlife. The “You’re Dead” text at the beginning of the visual display was a clear indication that every part of the concert after that point was meant to be experienced in the afterlife. A lot of the visuals were varied—ranging from very graphic, gory scenes to images that looked like neurons firing action potentials in the brain.<br /> The setlist was mainly centered around songs from the You’re Dead album, covers, and Captain Murphy songs, which is his side project. Personally, I could have done without his cover of Travi$ Scott’s “Antidote” with Scott’s vocals extremely pitched up, but the rest of the set was amazing and very well-mixed. Other covers included Lunice’s “Can’t Wait To” and “Pass That S***” by DJ Rashad.
