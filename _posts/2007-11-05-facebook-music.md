    Facebook, the online social community craze, could use the upcoming ad:tech convention in New York City to announce their latest (rumored) music component, Facebook Music, suggests Co-Ed Magazine.com. The speculation follows possible &#8220;top-secret meetings between the website and high-level representatives at each of the four major labels,&#8221; according to the site. This new feature, which is said to be similar to programs such as iTunes and MySpace Music, would use artist pages to let fans, &#8220;play music, watch videos, upload pictures, add music to their page, receive tour information and interact with other fans.&#8221; Held this year at the New York Hilton from November 5-8, the ad:tech, an interactive advertising and technology conference, will showcase a number of keynote speakers and workshops concerning the fields of marketing and technology.
