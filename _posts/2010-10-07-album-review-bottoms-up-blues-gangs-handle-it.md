    WC Handy may have written a song named the &#8220;St. Louis Blues&#8221;, but it&#8217;s not really about St. Louis, is it? It&#8217;s really about a bad woman from St. Louis. I&#8217;ve met a few bad STL women myself, but does the song really command it&#8217;s title? On their newest album Handle It, the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thebubg">Bottoms Up Blues Gang</a> have penned a song that would suit the name quite nicely. It&#8217;s called the &#8220;South Broadway Blues&#8221; and it kicks off the disc with a pitch perfect tune about hopping between blues venues on S. Broadway.

    St. Louis&#8217; very own BUBG has just produced this phenomenal new album that combines the beautiful, soulful vocals of Kari Liston with really tight instrumentation from guitarist Jeremy Segel-Moss along with a host of appearances from the rest of the Gang. This album hits many different styles from the New Orleans feel of &#8220;First Of May&#8221; to the sweet, wrenching intimacy of &#8220;If Only.&#8221; Although it may sound inappropriate, the Gang manages to squeeze in several upbeat blues songs, to keep the album going at a good pace. This album commands repeated listens, so go check it out.
