  <p>
    It looks like Scott Ingram, drummer for Jumbling Towers, will be leaving the band. He will, however, be playing with the band on Thursday&#8217;s KWUR Week show. Yet another reason to come to the show&#8230;

    Updated: Ingram will be leaving the band to attend Columbia College in Chicago.
