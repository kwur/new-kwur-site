  <p>
    In honor of Hustle Week, there&#8217;ll be a new addition to the Saturday Evening Post-up this week: an interview with a band that KWUR holds near and dear to its heart. First up, though, new music reviews:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Desolation Wilderness &#8211; &#8220;White Light Strobing&#8221;</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/desolationwilderness-794052.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/desolationwilderness-794048.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This album takes cues from both the folksy guitar of MMJ and the down-tempo ambient drone of MBV, combining them into a quiet, mostly sparse soundscape. This certainly might not be everyone&#8217;s cup of tea &#8211; derivative, boring, whatever &#8211; but if you&#8217;re looking for something warm, complex and mellow, give it a spin. (Also, dig up some records by Low and Galaxie 500 if you like this).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    RIYD: My Morning Jacket, My Bloody Valentine, Low<br />Play: 1 (downbeat, twangy), 2 (hypnotic, folksy beat and dreamy vocals), 3 (more droney, excellent), 7 (shorter, instrumental), 8 (beautiful little electro flourishes)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Manchester Orchestra &#8211; &#8220;Let My Pride Be What&#8217;s Left Behind&#8221; EP</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Andy Hull (vocals, guitar) originally wanted MO to be a solo project. He was listening to a lot Morrissey and The Smiths so the city of Manchester fascinated him. Then he also liked the idea of being a leader of an orchestra and have his friends guest. Hence, Manchester Orchestra. Sounds like alt rock with Ben Gibbard vocals.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    RIYD: Silversun Pickups, The Weakerthans<br />Play: 1, 3 (live, acoustic)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Noah And The Whale &#8211; &#8220;Peaceful, The World Lays Me Down&#8221;</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Laura Marling & Emny The Great used to be a part of this London band before they went solo. But they still perform with the band here and there &#8211; backing female vocals here are Marling&#8217;s. The band name is a combination of the movie title &#8220;The Squid and The Whale&#8221; and the director of the movie, Noah Baumbach. The band often sign emails and myspace posts with &#8220;Sic Transit Gloria,&#8221; a phrase frequently used in Wes Anderson&#8217;s &#8220;Rushmore.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    RIYD: Pete and the Pirates, Laura Marling<br />Play: 7, 3, 2
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Love Is All &#8211; &#8220;A Hundred Things Keep Me Up At Night&#8221;</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Spaztastic avant-pop from Sweden &#8211; nice contrast between snarling female vocal delivery and dancey pop guitar lines/drumming. Sometimes anthemic, sometimes saxophone-fueled dance freakout, always a lot of fun.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    RIYD: Shout Out Louds, CSS, Arctic Monkeys<br />Play: 1 (upbeat, dig the horns. spazzy), 2 (more sax, more spaz), 3 (rippin&#8217; guitar line), 5 (standout track, fucking rocks but watch the disclaim), 9 (another standout, catchy and anthemic), 10 (folk-ish, awesome female/male call-response)

  <p>
    And, as promised, (part of) the Sample 1996 interview with Neutral Milk Hotel:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sample: How did you get together for the tour?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jeff Mangum: Julian called me in New York and said, &#8220;Well, if you want to do a tour for the record, I can do it.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Julian Koster: [to Jeff] Why don&#8217;t you start with Scott and how you guys grew up together and stuff?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jeff: Well, you started the whole mess.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Julian: I said start with you two&#8230; chronologically.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Scott Spillane: I wasn&#8217;t included in the band until the day before he left.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Julian: I thought she was more interested in where you came from&#8230; they used to be in a band called The Clay Bears together.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jeff: I wasn&#8217;t really planning on touring at all. I mean I hadn&#8217;t really thought about it. It just seemed like getting a band together would be hard. I&#8217;m not really good at taking responsibility for everybody and calling up a bunch of people and saying &#8220;Hey, come on, come fuck up your life for me.&#8221; But Julian sort of gave me the incentive to have the guts to do that. I knew Scott for six years in Louisiana. So I was on my way from Denver to New York, because his grandmother lives out there, and we were going to practice in her basement. Scott was living in his van in Austin, TX. He was sleeping in front of Gumby&#8217;s Pizza Parlor, where he worked. And the night before I left it dawned on me that&#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Scott: The night before he left he came in and it was 2:00 in the morning and he said &#8220;I just stopped by to say goodbye.&#8221; Then we got hit by this big rush and I asked him to come help me make pizzas and he said &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to do.&#8221; So he was slinging pizza juice around and then right before he left he said &#8220;Hey man, I just realized something. This job really sucks. So why don&#8217;t you come with us,&#8221; and I said okay.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jeff: Yeah that would be it. And all he had was&#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Scott: All I had was my guitar and my amp.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jeff: I didn&#8217;t even know that he could play horn or anything.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sample: What exactly is the Elephant Six Recording Collective?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jeff: It started out as a label and then now it&#8217;s sort of a symbol for our friendship. I don&#8217;t really have a definition for it. Everybody has their own little definition.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Julian: A family crest for a group of friends.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sample: Does it involve other projects outside of music?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Julian: It does.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jeff: We&#8217;re probably going to end up living in a farmhouse somewhere.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sample: Like a commune?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jeff: Sort of, yeah. We all kind of want to just disappear.
  </p>
