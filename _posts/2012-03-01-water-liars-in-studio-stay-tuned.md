    Last week, Water Liars stopped by and recorded an AWESOME set in our station. &nbsp;Due to technical difficulties (what's new) the session couldn't be broadcast live, but look forward to the session being replayed on-air soon! In the meantime, check out some trax on their website,&nbsp;http://misrarecords.com/artists/water-liars/ &nbsp;and check back for updates on when you can hear the session!
