    John Whitney was an experimental animator and composer. He is widely considered to be one of the fathers of computer animation.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    After studying music composition in Paris, he returned to the U.S. and began collaborating with his brother, James, to produce abstract animations. Their work, <i>Five Film Exercises</i> (1940-45) was awarded first prize at the First International Experimental Film Competition in 1949. By 1950, he was creating animation sequences for television.

  <p>
    In 1958, he collaborated with title-sequence pioneer, Saul Bass, on the spirographic opening of Alfred Hitchcock&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">Vertigo</span>. In 1966, he was awarded IBM&#8217;s first artist-in-residency. Until the 1970s, most of Whitney&#8217;s animations made use of a complex analog computer. By the mid-1970s his animations were made completely with digital technologies. His work often uses self-composed music that explored mystical or Native-American themes. He continued making films until his death in 1995.

  <p>
    <span>&#8220;In PERMUTATIONS, each point moves at a different speed and moves in a direction independent according to natural laws&#8217; quite as valid as those of Pythagoras, while moving in their circular field. Their action produces a phenomenon more or less equivalent to the musical harmonies. When the points reach certain relationships (harmonic) numerical to other parameters of the equation, they form elementary figures.&#8221;- John Whitney</span>
