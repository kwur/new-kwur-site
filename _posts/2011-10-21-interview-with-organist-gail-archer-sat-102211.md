  <p>
    <a href="http://www.gailarcher.com/">Gail Archer</a>, a concert organist based in New York City, is traveling to the St. Louis area to give an organ recital at St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Ladue this Sunday, 10/22/11, at 5 PM.&nbsp; I will be interviewing Ms. Archer live on my Saturday classical show starting around 1 PM.&nbsp; She has a new album out called <a href="http://www.meyer-media.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=44">Franz Liszt: A Hungarian Rhapsody</a> on the Meyer Media label.&nbsp; Admission to the concert at St. Peter's is free, and it should end in time for everyone to get home for baseball.&nbsp; As always, feel free to drop me a line (classical@kwur.com) with any questions.
