<div class="pf-content">
  <p>
    It&#8217;s almost that time again &#8211; starting this Friday, the masses will once again converge upon Grant Park, Chicago to see this year&#8217;s arguably <a href="http://www.lollapalooza.com/schedule2008/day1.asp">best concert-festival line-up</a>. I&#8217;ll be there, along with a few other KWUR folks, and we&#8217;re going to be reporting live as only KWUR DJs can. So, keep your eye on the blog in the next few days for pictures, updates on the shenanigans, and whatever else I feel like posting after hanging out with crusty hippies at the Blues Traveler show.
