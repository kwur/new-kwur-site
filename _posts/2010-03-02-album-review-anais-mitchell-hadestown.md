    <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/cov200/drn500/n564/n56442sjv58.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 181px;" src="http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/cov200/drn500/n564/n56442sjv58.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">So this is the music from a “folk opera” Mitchell wrote around 2006, performed by Mitchell and several relatively big voices (Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon, Ani DiFranco, Petra Haden & the other two Haden Triplets). Putting the Orpheus/Eurydice myth into a post-apocalyptic yet Depression-like setting, this brings together a ton of great sounds: tin-pan-alley, ghostly folk, Waits-ian narrative, Appalachian bluegrass, and some terrific songwriting.</span>

    <span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">At times, the lyrical content gets a little wrapped up in narrative and therefore loses a little focus as a recording, but this is really a captivating release.</span>

    <span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">A very nice touch is that Vernon, as Orpheus, is usually the only singer with multi-tracked vocals, emphasizing the beauty of Orpheus’s song – it works wonders to utilize both his soulful baritone and his haunting falsetto. Mitchell, as well, has a fascinatingly strange voice, which is beautifully used here.</span>
