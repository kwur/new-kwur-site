    <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/buddha1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 205px; height: 137px;" src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/buddha1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>So I finally did it. I <a href="http://www.forcedexposure.com/artists/fm3.html">bought</a> a <a href="http://www.fm3.com.cn/buddhamachine.htm">Buddha Machine</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you haven&#8217;t heard yet the Buddha Machine is a hardware loop machine.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Basically <span style="font-weight: bold;">FM3</span>, an electronic group from China, programmed 9 of thier loops into a little handheld radio looking device (colors shipped randomly&#8211;awesome). You can select one of the 9 loops and play it through the attached lo-fi speaker or through the headphone jack. The droning loop will play continously until you turn the device off.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When I first heard of this thing and I figured it was just another hipster fad. After I read glowing reviews of the device time after time I went on ahead and threw down the $23 bucks this thing costed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Apparently <span class="desc">&#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alan Bishop</span> bought twenty-four of these on sight and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Brian Eno</span> bought eight&#8221;. Add Klax to the list. It sounded like an interesting venture into mass produced experimental music. Plus there is nothing like having a take anywhere droning loop machine.</p> 
    
    <p>
      Full review to come when it arrives on Friday. Can&#8217;t wait to see what color I get.
