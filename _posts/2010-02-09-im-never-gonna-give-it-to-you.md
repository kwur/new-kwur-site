  <p>
    <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">So a few posts ago, we gave you a review of the new Owen Pallet album </span><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Heartland</span></i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">. Here is an in-studio (live) performance of &#8220;Lewis Takes Off His Shirt&#8221; (aka the best song on the album) from CBC&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/q/">Studio Q</a> (thanks to </span><a href="http://www.pitchfork.com"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">P4k</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">).</span>

    <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">That this is a live performance makes this song even more exciting. If you weren&#8217;t aware, Pallet primarily performs songs live alone or with one other person (as in this performance, seen here with Thomas Gill) but his arrangements seem to require more than just one or two people. To make up for this (and add a whole lot of awesome), Pallet plays part of the arrangement on a keyboard or violin and then loops it over itself. This deepens the sound and enables him to play something else. I am also in complete awe at his control to play the violin and sing (listen for the chorus&#8217;s melody on the violin during the 3rd verse).</span>
