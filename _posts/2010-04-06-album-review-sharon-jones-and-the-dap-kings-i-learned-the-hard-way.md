  <p>
    With this fourth album from this legendary Brooklyn soul revival group, Sharon Jones&#8217; Muscle Shoals style gutbusting vocals are a given. The real stars here are the Dap-Kings, whose ability to perfectly capture the sounds of 60s/70s soul blur the line between soul revival and a long lost dusty Atco record. No other band in the world can do what they do, play all!

    But esp: 1+++(perfectly smooth Philly fanfare), 2+++(hottest shit ever), 3++(nice &#8216;n&#8217; laid back), 4++, 6 (instr.), 7+++(just great), 12+++(Sharon Jones is the star here)
