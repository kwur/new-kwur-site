  <p>
    If you missed seeing Tom Waits on <a href="http://www.tomwaitslibrary.com/performances1949-1975.html">July 5, 1974</a> in St. Louis and assured yourself that he would come back to town soon, I&#8217;m very sorry because you were quite mistaken. After an absence from St. Louis of over 30 years, Tom Waits will play the Fox Theater on June 26th. The wait is over, at long last! No details about tickets yet, but these are sure to go fast.
