    So once upon a time in 1971, The Jackson 5 were the biggest black group in America. Within Motown they essentially replaced the Supremes as the labels flagship group. Motown moved out to California as did the Jacksons and began to market the hell out of the boys. They were on lunchboxes, coloring books, dolls and stickers. At the height of this, ABC ran a Saturday morning cartoon series called <span style="font-style: italic;">the Jackson 5ive</span> from 1971-1973. Other than appearing in the introduction, the Jacksons did not contribute to the show in any way except their songs. In fact, I think a lot of their voices were provided by older white men. Which is weird.

    Here’s a pretty interesting episode:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It’s called Rasho Jackson and its based on the 1950 Akira Kurosawa mystery <span style="font-style: italic;">Rashomon</span>. It tells the story of the breakup of the Jacksons from the different perspective of each member.
