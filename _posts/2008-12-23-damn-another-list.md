Lotsa of jams (in no order):
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thee Oh Sees &#8211; The Master&#8217;s Bedroom Is Worth Spending a Night In, Thee Hounds of Foggy Notion (CD/DVD), Peanut Butter Oven EP</span><br />I&#8217;ll be the first to admit, I&#8217;m a John Dwyer (Coachwhips, Pink and Brown, Yikes) fanboy. Luckily his newest band, Thee Oh Sees, remain prolific. Three great releases in one year.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Brian Jonestown Massacre &#8211; My Bloody Underground</span><br />Just like the title suggests, the Brian Jonestown Massacre unapologetically combined their My Bloody Valentine and Velvet Underground influences and we get another great psychedelic LP. Worth the four year wait?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Fall &#8211; Imperial Wax Solvent</span><br />Since The Fall basically release and album every year, they will always be on my list. They are the most consistent band of all time. This, their twenty-something-th release, still delivers.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Black Angels &#8211; Directions To See a Ghost, Black Angel Exit EP</span><br />More awesome Texas neo-psychedelia. Nothing has changed with this band and that&#8217;s a good thing.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Times New Viking &#8211; Rip It Off</span><br />I think everyone enjoyed this abrasive lo-fi as shit pop music.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sic Alps &#8211; U.S. EZ</span><br />Noisy San Francisco experimental garage rock that can&#8217;t be beat.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Group Inerane &#8211; Guitars From Agadez (Music of Niger)</span><br />Sublime Frequencies delivers the goods as usual. I think they describe it best: &#8220;Group Inerane is the now sound of the Tuareg Guitar Revolution sweeping across the Sahara Desert and inspired by the rebel musicians that started this music as a political weapon used to communicate from the Libyan Refugee camps in the 1980s and 1990s&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dead Meadow &#8211; Old Growth</span><br />Heavy pot music.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Awesome Color &#8211; Electric Aborigines</span><br />The young 21st century Stooges. I think their first album was better but this certainly is a band to keep watching.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-style: italic;"><br />Reissues/Not New</span>:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Clean &#8211; Compilation</span><br />A classic reissued on vinyl.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pavement &#8211; Brighten The Corners: Nicene Creedence Edition</span><br />Another great issue of the continued spiffy Pavement remasters. I especially enjoyed the many Pavement psych-jams and covers included on the second disc, including covers of Faust and the Fall.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">King Khan and The Shrines &#8211; The Supreme Genius of King Khan and the Shrines</span><br />Big-band doo-wop garage rock? Awesome. This collects the best of their past material in one nice package.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Wooden Shjips &#8211; Volume 1</span><br />Modern kraut-rock jams. This release collects all their hard to find/limited edition early vinyl releases.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Flat Duo Jets</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8211; Two Headed Cow</span><br />Various live material from the past collected for the new documentary of the same name. Loud fuzzy Link Wray jams.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sun City Girls &#8211; You&#8217;re Never Alone With A Cigarette</span><br />&#8220;Recorded in July of 1988 during the sessions that produced Sun City Girl&#8217;s most popular recording, these nine tracks represent the other half of songs which were originally prepared as a 2-LP demo version of &#8216;Torch of the Mystics&#8217; for Placebo Records in 1989.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Henry Flynt (with C.C. Hennix) &#8211; Dharma Warriors<br /></span>Totality of liner notes: &#8220;Recorded to boombox Woodstock, New York 1983.&#8221; Two more lengthy &#8220;celestial rockabilly&#8221; jams that no one but Henry Flynt can deliver. Keep these archival releases coming&#8230;
