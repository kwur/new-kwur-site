    <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/FMcover-706565.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/FMcover-706551.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fecal Matter</span> was Kurt Cobain&#8217;s first band dating back to 1985. It featured Kurt Cobain on guitar and vocals and Dale Crover (of the Melvins) on drums. Cobain recorded several songs on his Aunt&#8217;s recording equipment and handed out cassettes (titled &#8220;Illiteracy Will Prevail&#8221;) to people he knew. Eventually, after the band broke up, Krist Novoselic finally listened to his copy and Nirvana was formed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The cassette was first rumored to exist in Michael Azerrad&#8217;s 1993 <span style="font-style: italic;">Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana</span>. Azerrad&#8217;s book is still the definitive volume on the band. He conducted more interviews with Kurt Cobain than anyone else. [Note: the recently released film, &#8220;Kurt Cobain: About a Son&#8221;, was entirely culled from these extensive interviews. In my view, this also makes it the definitive film about Kurt Cobain.]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Since only several copies were believed to still exist, this cassette became the &#8220;Holy Grail&#8221; of Nirvana bootlegs since it&#8217;s first mention. Everyone wanted it, but no one had it. It was so desired that a faked copy turned up in 1997.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A copy was proven to exist when &#8220;Spank Thru&#8221; was included on the completely unnecessary 2005 money-making release &#8220;Silver: Best of the Box&#8221;. Based on that track, this ultra-rare cassette seemed to be nothing more than low-fi Bleach-era Nirvana material.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Surprisingly, most of the cassette was finally leaked in November. I guess this wasn&#8217;t big news&#8211;I hadn&#8217;t even heard of the leak until a couple days ago.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    10 tracks of the rumored 16 are now available on the internets (I&#8217;ll let you find them on your own).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Tracklist (currently available):<br /><span class="thread_message">01. Sound Of Dentage<br />02. Commercials<br />03. Bambi Slaughter<br />04. Made Not Born<br />05. Unknown #1 (cut)</span><br /><span class="thread_message">06. Spank Thru<br />07. Unknown #6<br />08. Buffy&#8217;s Pregnant<br />09. Unknown #7<br />10. Downer</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When I first heard these I was not only surprised with their quality (it doesn&#8217;t sound like shit) but also how great the songs were. Only &#8220;Spank Thru&#8221; and &#8220;Downer&#8221; (in a much different form) were on any Nirvana releases.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is NOT <span style="font-style: italic;">Bleach</span>-era Nirvana. In my view, the songs are much more towards the experimental/noisy side&#8211;an area I always wish Nirvana had headed. Not surprisingly, Cobain claimed this was intentional. He claimed he was a big fan of the Butthole Surfers and Scratch Acid at the time. For Nirvana&#8217;s debut, <span style="font-style: italic;">Bleach,</span> he claimed Sub-Pop told the band to tone down this aspect of thier music.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is as noisy as you will ever hear Kurt Cobain. Hopefully the other 6 tracks will surface soon. Enjoy.
