McGurk&#8217;s</a> Pub in Soulard. The pub&#8217;s influence shows as Joe and Sean fill <span style="font-style:italic;">Loaded to the Gunwales</span> with Irish songs filtered through&#8217;s their americana style. Most songs are traditional, but you would be hard pressed to pick out the two original songs without looking at the liner notes.

    The album&#8217;s power springs from Joe and Sean singing simple and timeless songs. These songs are filled out by guest appearances on fiddle, accordion, and washtub bass. It isn&#8217;t the type of album that runs you over like a semi-truck, but it will seep into your brain on repeated listens. This disc is another in a long stream of good albums from these guys so don&#8217;t forget to check them out Sunday nights at McGurk&#8217;s.

    On Friday July 9 Joe Stickley and Sean Canan will play a live set on KWUR at about 2:30pm. Listen in!
