McGurk’s</a> Pub in Soulard. The pub’s influence shows as Joe and Sean fill <span style="font-style:italic;">Loaded to the Gunwales</span> with Irish songs filtered through’s their americana style. Most songs are traditional, but you would be hard pressed to pick out the two original songs without looking at the liner notes.

    The album’s power springs from Joe and Sean singing simple and timeless songs. These songs are filled out by guest appearances on fiddle, accordion, and washtub bass. It isn’t the type of album that runs you over like a semi-truck, but it will seep into your brain on repeated listens. This disc is another in a long stream of good albums from these guys so don’t forget to check them out Sunday nights at McGurk’s.

    On Friday July 9 Joe Stickley and Sean Canan will play a live set on KWUR at about 2:30pm. Listen in!
