    Hey guys! I’ve just finished designing KWUR’s semesterly zine, SAMPLE, for the Spring semester. I’m really excited about it because I experimented a lot more with design this time, and just had fun with it. We’ll have physical copies available very soon in station, and possibly places around campus like Olin Library, the Bear’s Den and the art school. Thanks to all the DJ’s who submitted doodles, comics, poems, album reviews, and stories. I couldn’t have done it without you!
