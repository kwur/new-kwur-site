    Hey guys! I&#8217;ve just finished designing KWUR&#8217;s semesterly zine, SAMPLE, for the Spring semester. I&#8217;m really excited about it because I experimented a lot more with design this time, and just had fun with it. We&#8217;ll have physical copies available very soon in station, and possibly places around campus like Olin Library, the Bear&#8217;s Den and the art school. Thanks to all the DJ&#8217;s who submitted doodles, comics, poems, album reviews, and stories. I couldn&#8217;t have done it without you!
