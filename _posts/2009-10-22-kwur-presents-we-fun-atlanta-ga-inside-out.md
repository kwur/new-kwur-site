    <span style="font-weight:bold;">THIS FRIDAY – OCTOBER 23RD – WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY: BROWN 100</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    From Paste Magazine:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A minor blues progression organ-vamps as the handheld camera zooms shakily into the devious grin of a young dude holding a dual-blaze firework lackadaisically, as if the object weren’t emitting a furious spark geyser next to his face.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This moment from a Black Lips concert in the group’s Georgia hometown kicks off the newly-released trailer for We Fun: Atlanta, GA Inside Out, a rock doc by Nashville filmmakers Chris Dortch and Matthew Robison (Silver Jew) and producer Bill Cody who lent his talents to the musical time capsule Athens, GA: Inside/Out (released in 1987).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The barrage of crowdsurfing, crotch fireballs, spirit-chugging and Whirlyball hints at what Dortch meant when he told Paste, “in my mind, we’ve got like 90 Anton [Newcombe]s floating around here [in Atlanta]. And there’s this legitimate love and camaraderie between them that you don’t find in other cities.” Among the merry bands of eccentrics in the film are Deerhunter, Mastodon, the Selmanaires, Anna Kramer, and the Coathangers.

  <p>
    Movie starts at 8, seventy minutes long.
