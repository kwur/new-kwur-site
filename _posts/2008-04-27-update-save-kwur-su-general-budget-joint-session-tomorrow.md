  <p>
    Well, we all fought hard to get the SU Treasury to fix our budget for next year, and although we were moderately successful (not really), the Senate (god bless &#8217;em) voted the proposed budget down. Now it&#8217;s time for ROUND 2!

  <p>
    There will be an SU General Budget Joint Session tomorrow at high noon (12 PM) in Simon Hall. Please, if you have the time, come support KWUR and the exec committees in general, and voice your (educated) opinion about the shortcomings of next year&#8217;s budget. The Facebook event is linked here: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=11751729348">http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=11751729348</a>. We need your help!
