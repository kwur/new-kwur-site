  <p>
    We’ve got a few special programs on the schedule, done by folks from the greater Wash U community, that I’d like to draw your attention to.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tuesdays 6:30-7:00 – Kemper Art Waves</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Every other Tuesday, join curators and friends from the Kemper as they discuss art and kulcha. This Tuesday, Dr. Meredith Malone discussed the exhibit “The Birth Of The Cool”, opening this Friday at the Kemper. In two weeks, Kemper Art Waves will return with an interview of a musicologist specializing in Miles Davis.

    </p>
    
    <p>
      </span><span>Tune in on Fridays to hear the editors of Cadenza, Student Life’s arts and entertainment section, hold forth on movies of all sizes and shapes. Last Friday, they reviewed “Burn After Reading” and commented on Moolah’s midnight showing of “Shawn Of The Dead”. This week, WHO KNOWS? You can get the fancy shmancy podcast on Stud Life’s website.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></p>

          </span><span>If you are a community group (whether Wash U or the greater St. Louis area), and you are interested in getting on the air, please shoot me an email at gm[at]kwur.com. There are still a few open slots, and I’d be happy to show you the ropes and make it happen.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span>
