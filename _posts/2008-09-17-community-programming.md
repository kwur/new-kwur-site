  <p>
    We&#8217;ve got a few special programs on the schedule, done by folks from the greater Wash U community, that I&#8217;d like to draw your attention to.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tuesdays 6:30-7:00 &#8211; Kemper Art Waves</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Every other Tuesday, join curators and friends from the Kemper as they discuss art and kulcha. This Tuesday, Dr. Meredith Malone discussed the exhibit &#8220;The Birth Of The Cool&#8221;, opening this Friday at the Kemper. In two weeks, Kemper Art Waves will return with an interview of a musicologist specializing in Miles Davis.

    </p>
    
    <p>
      </span><span>Tune in on Fridays to hear the editors of Cadenza, Student Life&#8217;s arts and entertainment section, hold forth on movies of all sizes and shapes. Last Friday, they reviewed &#8220;Burn After Reading&#8221; and commented on Moolah&#8217;s midnight showing of &#8220;Shawn Of The Dead&#8221;. This week, WHO KNOWS? You can get the fancy shmancy podcast on Stud Life&#8217;s website.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></p>

          </span><span>If you are a community group (whether Wash U or the greater St. Louis area), and you are interested in getting on the air, please shoot me an email at gm[at]kwur.com.
