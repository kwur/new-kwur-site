Personally, I was a little bit disappointed; this record isnâ€™t as dynamic as their old stuff, a little too sterile for my taste, and the slow stuff does nothing for me. Still, if you want to compel booty-shaking, this record is certainly capable of it.

    Play: 2++(killer breakdown), 3++(good set-ender), 4, 9+(sweet vocal hook), 10++(great slow jam), 13+ (cute)
