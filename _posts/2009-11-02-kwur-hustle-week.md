  <p>
    We wanted to take a brief moment and let you all know that this week is KWUR Hustle Week. It&#8217;s a time where we can be honest and let you know that radio isn&#8217;t cheap, and that we need some money. We&#8217;re not asking for much, anything, even a dollar, helps to keep KWUR as one of the last completely free form stations in the country. KWUR provides students and the St. Louis community with the unique opportunity to not only get involved with radio, but really shape how it works. So please, we&#8217;d love to have your support.

    You can call in your pledges to (314) 935-5952. We have DJ&#8217;s manning the phones this Monday through Friday from 10 AM to midnight. You can also email your pledge to gm [at] kwur.com.&nbsp; If you&#8217;d like to write a check, you can mail it to KWUR 90.3 FM, Campus Box 1205, One Brookings Dr., St. Louis, MO 63130. You can also stop by KWUR&#8217;s studios on Washington University&#8217;s campus in the back of the Women&#8217;s Building and make your contribution in person.&nbsp;
