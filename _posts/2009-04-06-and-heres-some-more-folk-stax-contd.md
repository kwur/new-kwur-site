    <span style="font-weight:bold;">HAYES CARLL – TROUBLE IN MIND</span><br />newish (08) album from songwriter fella from TEXAS who wants you to know it<br />actively places himself within tradition of guy clark, townes can zandt, steve earle, et cetera<br />some have criticized his over-reliance on texas country cliches and his perhaps affected, intense texas drawl<br />his cute songs are maybe too cute and his angsty songs are absolutely too angsty but I think I prefer both of these to his middle of the road, low-key ballads<br />this is his polished label debut and the slick production give him a big boost as far as hooks go<br />“drunken poet’s dream” (as overblown as it sounds) was cowritten by ray wylie hubbard and is the best song on the album<br />also: “she left me for jesus”

    <span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />SLIM CESSNA’S AUTO CLUB – S/T</span><br />greasy, smoky country gospel coming out of mid/late 90’s cowpunk alt bullshit, but clearly steeped in tradition<br />reverent, where any irony would have clouded their sometimes devotional bent<br />eery, riled-up yodely yelps can grate but definitely serve the spooky accordion/organ shuffle waltzes that fill the album<br />murder ballads<br />“I threw her in the river!”<br />surf/rockabilly licks and real simple dobro<br />I figure fans of that loud strummy acoustic guitar w/drum sound that’s so popular these days will dig this<br />and so do I

    <span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />SPADE COOLEY & THE WESTERN SWING DANCE GANG – SHAME ON YOU</span><br />okay, spade cooley killed his wife in a very groteque way and there was a pretty famous subsequent celebrity trial<br />look it up if you want the juicy details (they include theme parks and gay sex cults)<br />as far as the music goes: spade dubbed himself the king of western swing at the height of that music’s popularity (although history has fortunately awarded mr. wills that title)<br />spade’s swing (as opposed to harder texas stuff like wills’) is a slick, schmaltzy hollywood swing<br />his swing band swelled into a near orchestra, with a full-time orchestral harp player swinging with the rest of them<br />the production might strike a lot of you folk as too syrupy, but I really love it for what it is<br />meticulously crafted dancey pop in the c&w mode<br />the title track (great fodder for cute news headlines, no doubt) is a good start and a standout

    <span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />STEVE EARLE</span><br />80’s debut GUITAR TOWN rode the neo-traditionalist wave (think dwight yoakam, with whom he was often categorized at the time) into the charts<br />though he’s since been often grouped with fellow statemen guy clark, townes van zandt, et al. – that texas, earthy songWriter vibe<br />GT is all up in that big 80’s reverb with fwooshy hard rock deep snare hits w/heart-on-sleeve sentiments, rockabilly/Bakersfield clonky leads<br />whereas his most recent WASHINGTON SQUARE SERENADE finds earle, decades later, embracing self-consciously eclectic textured production and artsy, inventive arrangements, literate and socially conscious (ah, politics) lyrics<br />apparently a paean to his new adopted town of nyc + ode to its folk era greenwich village scene<br />

    <span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />CHARLIE FEATHERS – S/T</span><br />charlie is original sun gold<br />he shoulda coulda woulda been as big as elvis, big as cash, big as carl perkins at least<br />instead here (1990) on this wow exciting comeback album we find mr. Feathers vital and mean as ever, still raring to go<br />rockabilly before it needed that silly -billy distinction<br />charlie can growl in his resonant, bassy snarl one minute<br />and yelp or even squeeze out a convincing hoarse croon the next minute<br />this album is full of delicious, sloppy acoustic guitars and slap back delay effects<br />and clickety clack rimshots
