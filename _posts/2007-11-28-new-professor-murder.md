  <p>
    Head on over to <a href="http://rcrdlbl.com/artists/Professor_Murder/download/Flex-It_Formula">RCRD LBL</a> (can they please get at least one vowel in their name? Put a U in there, I really don&#8217;t care, I just die a little on the inside whenever I type that. Please?) to hear a new Professor Murder track. Professor Murder is a Brooklyn-based band that is the heir apparent to the dance-punk throne. Fans of !!!, Rapture, Radio 4, etc should take notice, if they haven&#8217;t already. Their debut EP, Professor Murder Rides The Subway, was released last year on Kanine Records.
