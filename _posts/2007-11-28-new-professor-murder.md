  <p>
    Head on over to <a href="http://rcrdlbl.com/artists/Professor_Murder/download/Flex-It_Formula">RCRD LBL</a> (can they please get at least one vowel in their name? Put a U in there, I really don’t care, I just die a little on the inside whenever I type that. Please?) to hear a new Professor Murder track. Professor Murder is a Brooklyn-based band that is the heir apparent to the dance-punk throne. Fans of !!!, Rapture, Radio 4, etc should take notice, if they haven’t already. Their debut EP, Professor Murder Rides The Subway, was released last year on Kanine Records.
