In 1987, he created a short 43 minute Karen Carpenter biopic using Barbie dolls.

    The film has become a piece of &#8220;illegal art&#8221; unable to be properly released because of current zealous copyright laws.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Stay Free! magazine&#8217;s <a href="http://www.illegal-art.org/">illegal art exhibit</a> explains it:<br />&#8220;<span class="main">With Barbie dolls as the principal actors, <i>Superstar</i> portrays the life of Karen Carpenter and her battle with anorexia. Haynes never secured the rights to the Carpenters&#8217; music he used in the movie, and Richard Carpenter filed an injunction that kept <i>Superstar</i> from public release. Even without Carpenter&#8217;s court order, the film would probably have been stopped by the notoriously litigious Mattel, the makers of Barbie.&#8221;</p>

      While most film prints were immediately recalled and destroyed, the Museum of Modern Art film archive holds a copy (although they&#8217;ve agreed to never show it).
