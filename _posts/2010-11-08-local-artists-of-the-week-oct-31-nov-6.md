    <strong>Local New Releases</strong>

  <p>
    <strong>Via Dove &#8211; El Mundo Latino</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.viadove.com/">Via Dove</a> creates a solid album with a very good rocking mix of songs that are all good enough for radio play. The album starts off very quick tempoed, with a good &#8220;party&#8221; feel and progresses to a slower tempo as it continues. These are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> very solid songs.

  <p>
    <strong> Spelling Bee &#8211; Sweet Dreams, Strange Animal</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This weird noisy rock duo permeates energy whether it comes in the form of spastic rhythms or a wall of sound bowling you over at their live shows. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/beespellingbee">Spelling Bee</a>&#8216;s drummer Joseph Hess once described their band to me as &#8220;stupid loud,&#8221; and I cannot disagree with his assessment. Along with singer and guitarist Mabel Suan, they create fast, aggressive songs that frequently change rhythms. Their debut &#8220;Sweet Dreams, Strange Animal&#8221; on APOP Records captures their live energy well, with the added bonus that you can control the volume on your home stereo.
