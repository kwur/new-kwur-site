    Hot damn, I nearly forgot &#8211; it&#8217;s Saturday, and I am required by law to post reviews and charts. So here, have some new release reviews in celebration of our newly elected President:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Upchuck &#8211; &#8220;Gone But Not Forgotten&#8221;</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Compilation of work by Seattle punk and glam rocker Charles Gerra, whose projects with the most attention were The Fags and Such in NYC. The first three tracks are from his early Seattle glam outfits, the others are almost exclusively Such. Chuck died of AIDS in 1990, but has been cited as a major influence on the Pacific Northwest&#8217;s music scene that would explode in the late 80&#8217;s/early 90&#8217;s.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Play: 4 (industrial, dark), 7 (like some Roxy Music), 1 (late 70&#8217;s upbeat punkish glam)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Sebastien Grainger &#8211; &#8220;Sebastien Grainger and the Mountains&#8221;</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/and_themountains-721231.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 168px;" src="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/and_themountains-721226.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>

    A super-sexy first release for the lone stallion Mr. Grainger. All the seduction of DFA 1979 is poured like chocolate sauce on this album. Good music for a long drive home or a hipster dance party &#8211; only, with dancing. Beat-heavy tracks like 1, 2, 3, or 12 are grounded by rock n roll sweetness in tracks 8 and 11 to create a balance that is just right. I really enjoy this album &#8211; but I think deep down inside, Grainger misses DFA 1979. I know I do, and it shows in this CD. 9/10
  </p>
  
  <p>
    RIYL: Death From Above 1979, The Killers<br />Play: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Grampall Jookabox &#8211; &#8220;Ropechain&#8221;</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    With &#8220;Ropechain,&#8221; Grampall Jookabox leads us into a world of taut paranoia, guiding the way with anxious growls and yelps, far-out lyrics and bizarre, everything-including-the-kitchen-sink instrumentation. Primal drum beats pound behind honest-to-God freaked-out experimental sound collision. Yet, for as weird as it is, the album is equally funny and substantive &#8211; and even accessible.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    RIYL: Captain Beefhart, Animal Collective, TV on the Radio (on acid)<br />Play: 2 (weird but catchy as hell &#8211; play if yr feeling hyper and angsty), 3 (vocals on whippits, weird as shit), 4 (chanty vocals, shanty beats, hypnotic), 5 (funky? funny lyrics, gritty), 6 (love the lyrics, tense, good bass line), 11 (title says it all &#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;m Absolutely Freaked Out&#8221;)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">The Streets &#8211; &#8220;everything is borrowed&#8221;</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Fourth album by the British hip-hopper. Good, rich beats on most songs, but a few are just fucking annoying. Avoid the annoying ones and you&#8217;ll be fine. Not the greatest rap I&#8217;ve ever heard, but it&#8217;s got some moments. 6.5/10
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Play 1, 3, 4 (faster rapping), 6, 7, 9
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Juana Molina &#8211; &#8220;Un Dia&#8221;</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sounds like folktronica, loopy acoustic stuff. Used to be a comedic actress in South America (from Argentina). Following a military coup in Argentina in 1976, Molina&#8217;s family fled to Paris and lived in exile there for 6 years.

    RIYL: Mia Doi Todd, Hanne Hukkelberg<br />Play 1, 5, 6
