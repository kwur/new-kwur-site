    Hello listeners, alumni, parents, et al. Now marks the beginning of the annual Hustle Week, KWUR's yearly allocated time to ask a bit harder for money and support!

    We have some important opportunities in the near future that will be made possible by your donations, including the improvement of our current radio signal and a big push towards a new opportunity to increase our station's wattage. More details about our current situation, of particular interest&nbsp; to KWUR alumni, can be found here: <a href="http://kwur.com/alumni-letter/">http://kwur.com/alumni-letter/</a>

    Donations can be made this week by calling in to pledge at <a href="tel:%28314%29%20935-5952" value="+13149355952">(314) 935-5952</a>. DJs will be manning the phones most hours from 9:00 AM to midnight from Sunday to Saturday to take your pledges. (NOTE: Some people have contacted us wondering if there is an alternative method besides checks, i.e. paypal, to make donations. There currently is not, BUT pledge anyway and we'll work this week to figure out how to set one up). Make checks out to KWUR 90.3 FM, and send them to this address:
