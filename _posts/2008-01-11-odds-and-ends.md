    From <a href="http://dividing.wordpress.com/2008/01/10/the-new-pornographers-and-okkervil-river-at-the-pageant-on-april-19/">Dividing By Zero</a>, via RFT: The New Pornographers (along with Neko Case) and Okkervil River will be playing at the Pageant on April 19. This may become the most anticipated non-KWUR Week show of the semester (good thing you don&#8217;t have to choose, because KWUR Week will blow this out of the water). Check out the updated concert calendar more listings.

    From <a href="http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/atoz/2008/01/arcade_fires_will_butler_got_m.php">RFT</a>, via the Ladue News: Will &#8220;not Win&#8221; Butler of Arcade Fire got married &#8211; at Holmes Lounge! The next time you get a carvery wrap, remember &#8211; Arcade Fire was there. Here&#8217;s a question: if there was an Arcade Fire sandwich (like the celebrity sandwiches in delis), what would be on it? For some reason, I can see it being drenched in mayo.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.laduenews.com/content/articles/2008/01/11/society/ladue_lips/doc477d51f442865207269555.jpg"><img style="cursor: pointer; width: 200px;" src="http://www.laduenews.com/content/articles/2008/01/11/society/ladue_lips/doc477d51f442865207269555.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>
