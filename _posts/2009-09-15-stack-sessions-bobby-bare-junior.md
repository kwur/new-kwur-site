  <p>
    Bobby Bare Jr. and Band (sometimes also known as the Young Criminals&#8217; Starvation League) stopped by the station last week for some talk and some tunes.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We discussed: Shel Silverstein, America, guilty pleasures, bitter defeats (a failed Grammy bid as a young boy, an unsuccessful audition for the role of Shrek in the Broadway musical adaptation). These are some of the best recordings we&#8217;ve done so far (imho), so enjoy and make sure to pick up one of Bobby&#8217;s new albums and catch him live the next time he&#8217;s in town.
