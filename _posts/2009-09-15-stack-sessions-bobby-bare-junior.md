  <p>
    Bobby Bare Jr. and Band (sometimes also known as the Young Criminals’ Starvation League) stopped by the station last week for some talk and some tunes.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We discussed: Shel Silverstein, America, guilty pleasures, bitter defeats (a failed Grammy bid as a young boy, an unsuccessful audition for the role of Shrek in the Broadway musical adaptation). These are some of the best recordings we’ve done so far (imho), so enjoy and make sure to pick up one of Bobby’s new albums and catch him live the next time he’s in town.
