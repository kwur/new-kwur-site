    One thing which has always caught my interest is the film trailer&#8211; a minute-long montage meant to capture the entirety of a film in order to get the audience to want to see it. There are a lot of ways of doing this, with most current films going to the default option. I speak, of course, of the form used by every action movie; man with deep voice explains concept briefly while the screen is black, sudden action shot to &#8220;surprise&#8221; you (an explosion, if possible), a few random, out-of-context action shots more, and then the date the movie will be released. Sometimes this is done well, and sometimes this is done badly. Of course, there&#8217;s a variant which is actually quite similar for the quirky romantic comedy&#8211; light music, with the sound to a scene starting early while the title or name of a star shows on the screen, a few lighthearted scenes are shown, etc.

    Really what I&#8217;m getting at is that there are some trailers which are made well, and some which are made horribly. I&#8217;d always loved the idea that one day there would be a trailer which completely misled the audience about the nature of the movie&#8211; a trailer which showed a happy film where the film was a slasher pic, or something of that nature. This has been done to some degree by the false trailers made by amateurs for youtube, some of which are brilliant&#8211; for example, Brokeback to the Future<br />

    On the other hand, the trailer for Federico Fellini&#8217;s &#8220;Notti di Cabiria (Nights of Cabiria)&#8221; has the same effect in a real trailer.<br /><br />The real film, of course, is basically about how an aging prostitute is screwed over by the world, left destitute and alone, etc. I realize that the trailer indicates that this was for a translated re-release, but I am pretty sure that a similar trailer was used for the original release of the film. Many of the scenes shown are taken out of context in a way which makes them appear much happier than they are.

    On the other hand, there are some trailers which completely reject any sort of encapsulation of the plot&#8211; this trailer, for Ermanno Olmi&#8217;s 1961 satire &#8220;Il Posto (&#8220;The Position&#8221; or &#8220;The Job&#8221;)&#8221; just tries to get the aesthetic of the film across, over some nice jazz. I don&#8217;t know how successful it is, especially with the break in the middle for the dance scene, but it&#8217;s still nice&#8211;<br /><br />maybe I only like this one because I love the film, though.

    For a more modern, commercial, less art-house example, the first trailer for &#8220;Superman Returns&#8221; was utterly beautiful. Without really showing any plot points from the film, or even hinting at the plot, the trailer slowly builds up to the final reveal of Superman&#8217;s face, followed of course by the &#8220;S&#8221;. The trailer brings out the concept of Superman without revealing any elements of the plot, which is perfect for a character so archetypal, as well as one so deeply seated in the American psyche. Of course, the timing of the film helps&#8211; perhaps the first time since the Cold War where Americans have felt the need for a hero like Superman, unlike the anti-heroic Batman of the 90&#8217;s Tim Burton films. Maybe it&#8217;s just a lifetime of loving Superman, but this one gives me chills every time. The understatedness only makes it more effective.

    On a completely different tack, I love the trailer for &#8220;American Hardcore.&#8221; It seemed pretty ironic that a film about hardcore was so long, and had so little momentum. The trailer captured everything I needed to know from the film as far as I&#8217;m concerned&#8211; the film itself was more like a 20-minute Bonham drum solo than anything you&#8217;d hear at a punk show. I love hardcore punk because it&#8217;s fast and energetic, and that&#8217;s what I love about this trailer.

    Well anyway, that&#8217;s all I have to say for now, but maybe some day I&#8217;ll bring up some more. I love well-made ads in general, so it&#8217;s very likely I&#8217;ll post something about this in the future.
