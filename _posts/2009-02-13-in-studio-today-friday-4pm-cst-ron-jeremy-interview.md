    Tune into KWUR (www.kwur.com) online (or 90.3 FM as the radio dial flies) for a chat with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_jeremy">Ron Jeremy</a> at 4PM CST. At 6PM CST, he will be debating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Gross">Pastor Craig Gross</a> as part of the <a href="http://www.porndebate.com/">Great Porn Debate</a> in Graham Chapel. KWUR will likely cover this event live as well, barring any last-minute legal issues.

    Upon hearing the debate news, my brother exclaimed, “they’re letting Ron Jeremy speak in a church??!”

    From what I’ve heard, the chancellor is pretty dodgy about sex-related talk on campus. I’m sure he will not be gracing us with his presence, despite Ron Jeremy’s eloquent nature of public speech (must’ve learned it in porn or something…)

    p.s. Pastor Gross: friendliest <a href="http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=spot_the_pedo">pedosmile</a> ever
