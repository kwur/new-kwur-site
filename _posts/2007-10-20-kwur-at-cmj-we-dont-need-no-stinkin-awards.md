    While Hermano Rabbit, Craig, and Dan Kandy are getting cozy in the Holiday Inn, I figured I’d give you guys an update of what’s going on here at CMJ. On Thursday, we went to a couple panels, and learned how to make KWUR the best station in the world (don’t change a damn thing) before having a totally surreal hour or so. Over at the World’s Fair showcase, we saw Stardeath and the White Dwarfs, Tiny Masters of Today, and 1990’s – and John Norris. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/tinymasters">Tiny Masters of Today</a>, the band consisting of 13-year-old Ivan, his 11-year-old sister Ada, and <a href="http://www.beastiemania.com/whois/simins_russell/">Russell Simins</a>, put on a decent set, but ended it with a cover of House of Pain’s classic “Jump Around.” Ivan, finally without guitar, went all out and wound up sprawled out on the stage, covered in sweat. If I could have done something like that when I was 13, I would have been the happiest kid alive, so congratulations Ivan. After they were done, Craig, the eagle-eye, spotted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Norris_%28MTV_News_reporter%29">John Norris</a> of MTV News, so we went over and shot the shit with him for a few minutes. Then, right before the 1990’s came on, we talked to Kim and Seana, two actresses filming a webshow about two girls who go to all sorts of music festivals. They brought their own camera crew and made sure there was a clear path for them to be filmed, right at the front of the crowd. So as they “rocked out,” the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/1990sband">1990’s</a> put on a great show. It was high-energy and lots of fun, but the real question is why they went on so early. After a few more drinks (for us), they would have been even better.

    The beneficiary of more drinks (but not that many) was the Toronto band <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thegoldendogs">Golden Dogs</a>. In a crowded Mo Pitkin’s, they put on an amazing show that forced us to ask someone from Yep Roc to send us their CD.

    Yesterday, we saw a bunch of bands at the Fanatic party, including <a href="http://www.myspace.com/afuche">Afuche</a> and <a href="http://www.krecs.com/oldtimerelijun/">Old Time Relijun</a> before momentarily splitting up. As the Holiday Inners saw some hip-hop over in Williamsburgh, I (along with the KSLU girls) ran from the Lower East Side to Park Slope to see <a href="http://www.turbofruits.com/">Turbofruits</a>. Of course, they were great, and if you didn’t know them before, you should go check them out because I can not do them justice. Back in the Lower East Side, and reunited with KWUR, we saw <a href="http://www.patternismovement.com/">Pattern Is Movement</a>, who were great, but ended up being right before the showstealers in <a href="http://www.myspace.com/yeasayer">Yeasayer</a>. Watch out for Yeasayer. They consider themselves “Middle Eastern-Psych-Pop-Snap-Gospel,” but if you’re like me and don’t really know what that means, just take my word for it: they were awesome.

    Some bands that I wish I had seen are O’Death, Black Kids (who also were showstealers, according to allmusic, Pitchfuck, and a text message I got), Japanther, Health, and Vampire Weekend. On the docket for today, maybe, is more Yeasayer, Clockcleaner, Professor Murder, Matt and Kim, and of course, the St. Louis showcase from 8-10. Come check it out if you’re in New York, and if you’re not, stay tuned for more updates.
