  <p>
    Last Friday we were joined in the studio by <a href="http://www.myspace.com/bearceusemusic">Bear Ceuse</a>, aka Cameron Matthews. He played a few songs for us, and we discussed awesome St. Louis bands and his plans for moving to NYC. My two favorite songs (&#8220;O-K-L-A-EE-OHMA&#8221; and &#8220;I Saw It Beating&#8221;) are posted below for your viewing pleasure. Cameron has also decided that he&#8217;d like to host a show on KWUR this summer, so keep your ears open for his voice coming to you over the airwaves in the next weeks.
