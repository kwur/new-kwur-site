  <p>
    I got a little bogged down this week, so I haven&#8217;t been able to review CDs, but more will be on the way. In the meantime, a Kings of Leon fact: two of the brothers in the band wanted to be country stars, and dropped out of school to pursue country before switching genres. This little factoid wasn&#8217;t prompted by their new album leaking&#8230;not at all&#8230;..
