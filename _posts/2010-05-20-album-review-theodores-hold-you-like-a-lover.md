Theodore brings an ethereal honesty to their songs that make them stand on their own.

    Their new album <span style="font-style:italic;">Hold You Like A Lover</span> is cohesive in it&#8217;s intimacy. Opener &#8220;I Won&#8217;t be a Stranger&#8221; is the kind of song that builds into a perfect crescendo with lyrics that hit you in the heart. The middle of the album stretches out augmented by trumpet, tuba, banjo, harmonica, and more. &#8220;Half Pint&#8221; uses all these in a beautifully dynamic song that soars between screaming highs and intimate lows. &#8220;Send My Love&#8221; finishes off the album with a soft love song and leaves the listener with the reverberations of the slide lead still in his head.
