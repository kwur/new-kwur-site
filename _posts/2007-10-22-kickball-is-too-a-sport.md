    KWUR and sort-of rival <a href="http://kslu.slu.edu">KSLU</a> (of Saint Louis University) met recently to duke it out for the title of 2007 Saint Louis College Radio Champion of the World. On a beautiful, sunny Sunday afternoon, the teams met at Tower Grove Park for this semi-annual event. KWUR, who &#8220;brought the heat&#8221; more plentifully (We had 13 team members to KSLU&#8217;s 7), took an early lead, ending the first inning with an 8-1 lead. The seven-inning game continued as such, ending with a 15-3 victory for the ragtag KWUR team. KWUR will soon be the holders of the Homer Simpson doll kickball trophy.
