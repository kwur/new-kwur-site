  </p>
  
  <p>
    In addition to forever changing the worlds of puppetry and children&#8217;s television, he frequently made experimental shorts on the side. These included an experimental television piece titled <span style="font-style: italic;">The Cube</span>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    However, his masterpiece in the experimental arena is undoubtedly 1965&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">Time Piece. </span>The 9 minute film debuted at the Museum of Modern Art and had a short arthouse/festival run. In 1967 the film was nominated for an Academy Award in <span class="wikiwyg_section" id="wikiwyg_section_2">&#8220;Best Short Subject, Live Action Subjects&#8221;. Recently the film has been preserved by the Academy Film Archive.</p> 
    
    <p>
      &#8220;</span>Dislocation in time, time signatures, time as a philosophical concept, and slavery to time are some of the themes touched upon in this nine-minute, experimental film&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      I think this brilliant film proves once and for all that Jim Henson truly was a visionary.
