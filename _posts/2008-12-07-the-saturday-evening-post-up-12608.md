    Hope everyone had a relaxing break. No charts this week because of there was basically no one here last week, so instead I&#8217;ve got a ton of new reviews, the last part of the Neutral Milk Hotel review, and a LISTENERS POLL OMG OMG OMGGGG anyway check this shit out first:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">The Decemberists &#8211; &#8220;Always The Bridesmaid: A Singles Series (vol 1-3)&#8221;</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Colin Meloy is back with the Decemberists on this new compilation of singles. Pretty standard Decemberists stuff &#8211; horns, hooks, awesome chorus, Colin&#8217;s voice, strings, etc. Pretty good tracks overall, though not exactly innovative given their previous releases.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Play: 1, 5 (Velvet Underground cover), 6
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Three Second Kiss &#8211; &#8220;Long Distance&#8221;</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Italian deconstructed rock trio puts out a trebly, dissonant, angular disc that offers more raw energy than darkness typical of the &#8220;math&#8221; genre. Produced by Steve Albini (!), this band bears resemblance to a busier Shellac, a more organized U.S. Maple,, or even a late Fugazi. Vocals are a groaning ESL stew. Hear!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Play: 1 (militant with distorted vocals), 2 (develops well with some classic mathy guitar riffs), 5 (clanging chords with rumbling close bass harmonies opens wider than most), 6 (chanting, minimal)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">The Gentle Guest &#8211; &#8220;We Are Bound To Save Some Souls Tonight&#8221;</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Combines a lot of sounds for a rhythmic, folksy, and fun album. Sounds like Reel Big Fish meets Drive-By Truckers at times, other times more like a raspy ballad of Tom Waits or Bob Dylan. The stripped down feel is like early Ray LaMontagne, only not as tender and more upbeat.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Ryan Adams and the Cardinals &#8211; &#8220;Cardinology&#8221;</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Pretty subtle album, definitely one of the better ones in the huge amount of music under his belt. Solid lyrics, nice hooks. Takes a couple of listens to appreciate the details but I&#8217;d definitely give this a try. A bit predictable though, not as edgy as &#8220;Heartbreaker,&#8221; but still good overall.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Play: 2, 4 (a bit radio pop-esque), 7
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Megapuss &#8211; &#8220;Surfing&#8221;</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Devendra Banhart, Gregory Rogove (drummer of Priestbird), and others &#8211; including Fabrizio Moretti of The Strokes and many from Little Joy &#8211; combine to create an all around groovy album. One of my favorites of the year.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    RIYD: MGMT, The Black Keys, Devendra, Little Joy
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Play: 1 (good for lovin), 5 (&#8220;too much fun&#8230;&#8221; so catchy), 9 (rockin), 10 (disclaim but rocks)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Part 3/3 of the NMH interview:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sample: In regards to the CD (On Avery Island), all the songs run together and you can tell that there&#8217;s an ongoing theme. Two or three of the songs sound rather similar in parts. I know it&#8217;s not a rock opera, but is there an overriding concept? Or is it entirely subconscious?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Scott: I&#8217;ve got a really good answer!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jeff: You&#8217;re going to give some bullshitty&#8230; alright.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Scott: Okay, but don&#8217;t put this answer in unless he wants it. He only knows two chords!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jeff: It&#8217;s more like a story than a concept in the sense that a concept can be overly done. I&#8217;m not &#8220;conceptual&#8221; in the full sense of the word. It&#8217;s not supposed to be a book where the opening song is page one and it works up to the end. There is definitely a story, but at the same time, there&#8217;s not a very rigid structure. Do you understand?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sample: Well, although there&#8217;s a story, I have no idea what it&#8217;s about. Any explanation I&#8217;ve come up with is by virtue of just making something up to find something.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jeff: I write lots of songs that relate to each other and some of them end up being released and others don&#8217;t so it&#8217;s an ongoing thing where the same story is continued in my songs&#8230; I just keep writing until it&#8217;s finished and they cut it up into different parts. Because people are going to relate to songs and relate them to their lives, it&#8217;s not just a one-sided, either you get it or you don&#8217;t, story.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sample: Are the different styles on the album used to convey or correspond with different moods? Something will be lo-fi and folky, the opening track is more pop-oriented&#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Scott: It&#8217;s because you forgot how you mixed and got that sound earlier&#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jeff: Each song has it&#8217;s own mood&#8230; that&#8217;s why I was trying to record at home. I&#8217;m into home recording, not lo-fi. Home recording gives the freedom to deal with something for a long time, not so much &#8220;Let&#8217;s make the song sound shitty.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sample: Were some of the songs on the album recorded in the studio and others at home?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jeff: They were all recorded at home. But we had a reel-to-reel four track and a little board console.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sample: Isn&#8217;t it hard to hold down a job and tour?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jeff: Every time I quit a job, I would say, &#8220;My mom fell down the stairs. I have to go. Sorry.&#8221; And then come back in two weeks and say, &#8220;She&#8217;s better,&#8221; and get my job back&#8230; my mom got really mad and tired of it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Scott: That&#8217;s bad karma.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    fin.
