    <span style="font-weight:bold;">RAY WYLIE HUBBARD</span><br />he wrote “up against the wall redneck mother” woo!<br />and I fucking bet he never pictured the UT fratboy singalongs<br />back when he was a legit s. texas cosmic cowboy, one of jerry jeff walker&#8217;s lost gonzos<br />as far as his representation in the KWUR stacks goes, LOST TRAIN OF THOUGHT serves up some crisp (sterile?) neotonkabilly with mixed results<br />but by the 2000s we find mr. Hubbard has discovered The Blues (esp. evident in THE GROWL), replete with murky muddy swampy production, courtesy Gurf Morlix<br />dig for the hooks

    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqz3BZd3cV8">here&#8217;s the famous one [embedding disabled]</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">DOYLE LAWSON & QUICKSILVER</span><br />theoretically these folks play gospel bluegrass (bluegrass gospel?) but the gospel tracks tend to not really sound very much like bluegrass<br />instead, this very traditional, straight gospel in the close-harmonied men&#8217;s group tradition<br />white gospel, sure, but not especially country-sounding gospel (as country as it is bluegrass—and both connotations only make sense in terms of the spare acoustic guitar accompaniment)<br />that said, these albums are very well-executed, nice primers for folks interested in digging into white gospel proper
  </p>

  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />THE MEAT PURVEYORS – ALL RELATIONSHIPS ARE DOOMED TO FAIL</span><br />the meat purveyors play their bluegrass fast and dirty<br />they don&#8217;t play loose with the style too much – pretty strictly quick flatt &#8216;n scruggs style romps<br />but they are undoubtedly one of the more mean-spirited, unsentimental bluegrass bands around<br />this album has some of their best knockout gems—quick daggers of songs<br />“hey little sister” is about suspected domestic abuse: <br />“I seen that bruise on the back of your arm<br />if I find that man&#8217;s been doing ya harm&#8230;<br />I&#8217;ll cut him down!”<br />the heartbreak numbers have an exquisite and almost psychotic despair to them<br />dig “circus clown” in that respect (“does this look like a painted on frown to you?”)

  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">BILL NEELY – TEXAS LAW AND JUSTICE</span><br />this is probably my favorite discovery from the cd stacks<br />listened to the album on repeat for days after<br />so, mr. neely tried real hard to make it as a songwriter in country music (nashville)<br />but no luck<br />these are his 1970s home-recorded demo takes<br />some of the best unknown country songs around – heartbreak and redemption songs both<br />as far as demos intended to sell songs go, the quality of these performances is really astounding<br />pitch-perfect and emotionally-resonant<br />the man&#8217;s got a lovely warm drawling voice and he sings these in a bluesy, pre-honky-tonk style<br />(I guess he was a couple decades too late)<br />in “on a blackland farm” he describes meeting Jimmie Rodgers and learning how to play from him and I certainly would believe it<br />his gospel songs, esp. &#8211; “satan&#8217;s burning hell” are fierce stuff (sit up there with louvins&#8217; best)

    <span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />WILLIE NELSON – OHBOY CLASSICS PRESENTS</span><br />willie nelson is the proud owner of the most affected/affecting singing style in this solar system – equally aggravating and endearing, obnoxious and moving<br />he plays guitar like if django reinhardt only had one finger (I am quoting somebody on that last bit)
