    Nashville’s <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jakeandjamin">JEFF The Brotherhood</a> dominated Open Lot last Tuesday, alongside St. Louis’ very own <a href="http://www.myspace.com/beespellingbee">Spelling Bee</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/radicalsons">Radical Sons</a>. It was one of the best shows I’ve seen all summer, and I’m hoping they roll through town again soon (seriously, check out their myspace – I can’t quite place their sound but I’m pretty sure my co-MD would dig it. Thoughts, Dan?) Anyway, I sat down with bros Jake and Jamin after their set for a very entertaining, fairly drunken conversation about the Nashville scene, running a record label, and things we love and hate.
