    <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/521045859_f72664b21c_b-721280.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 257px; height: 196px;" src="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/521045859_f72664b21c_b-721259.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>In 1977 Charles Burnett completed his UCLA Masters Thesis <span style="font-style: italic;">Killer of Sheep</span>. He filmed the movie basically by himself on weekends in 1972 and 1973.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The film is undoubtedly a classic of American cinema. It was one of the 50 first films to enter the Library of Congress&#8217; National Film Registry (along side such films as <span style="font-style: italic;">Wizard of Oz</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Star Wars</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Vertigo</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Citizen Kane</span>) where it will be preserved for future generations.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Burnett was able to make this masterpiece completely outside any big budget corporate Hollywood studio for a price of only $10,000 (which is an amazingly small budget for any movie &#8211; let alone an outstanding one).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The film captures urban African-American culture in 1970&#8217;s Los Angeles. It tells the story of Stan, a slaughter house worker, and his family in loosely connected episodes. Often times the camera just observes the actions of everyday life in this community. Burnett used non-professional actors and filmed completely on location. These low budget, but arguably better and more realistic techniques, recollect the radical style of post-war Italian cinema (Italian Neo-Realism). To celebrate the history of African-American music Burnett created a soundtrack that songs from all eras.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But it was this soundtrack that made the film literally &#8220;the best film you&#8217;ve never seen&#8221;. Burnett was unable to secure proper licensing for the soundtrack, so the film, while critically acclaimed, had no official theatrical release until 30 years after it was completed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Thankfully, director<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Soderbergh" title="Steven Soderbergh"></a>Steven Soderbergh put down the $150,000 needed to license the soundtrack (except for one song). After a nice preservation job at the UCLA Film Archive (blowing the original 16mm print up to a theater friendly 35mm one), the film was finally given a proper (although limited) theatrical release earlier this year. [The film played at the Tivoli for less than a week this summer].
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So where does this leave us? Well, this month a nice <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Killer-Sheep-Charles-Burnett-Collection/dp/B000VEA3MU/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-2489089-5812752?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1194476204&sr=1-1">DVD boxset</a> of some of Charles Burnett&#8217;s early films is being released. This is the first official home video release of the film (and it isn&#8217;t bootleg quality&#8230;).<br /><span class="on" style="display: block;" id="formatbar_CreateLink" title="Link" onmouseover="ButtonHoverOn(this);" onmouseout="ButtonHoverOff(this);" onmouseup="" onmousedown="CheckFormatting(event);FormatbarButton('richeditorframe', this, 8);ButtonMouseDown(this);"></span><br />OK, great. What else? Well, if you missed the short run of the film this summer at Tivoli, <a href="http://www.webster.edu/filmseries/current.html">Webster Film Series</a> (really the only place worth seeing films in St. Louis) will be showing the film this January on the 17 through the 19. And don&#8217;t make me remind you that seeing the actual film is always better than DVD&#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    AND&#8230; to top that, Charles Burnett himself will be doing a free workshop on Saturday January 19th. You must RSVP to that event so visit the <a href="http://www.webster.edu/filmseries/index.htm">Webster Film Series</a> site for information. I&#8217;ll even be in town (from NY) attending that event, so see you there.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It should also be noted that Burnett is only one of a few filmmakers who has received the highly prestigious <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacArthur_Award">MacArthur Fellowship</a> (&#8220;genius grant&#8221;).
