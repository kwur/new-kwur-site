  <p>
    For this installment of "Five Songs to Listen To" we have some timeless and generally&nbsp;spacey (mostly) electronic music from rising producer William Thurman, also known as Royer. While he's currently residing in Chicago and putting out sexy deep house tunes on Tasteful Nudes and Material Image, he has roots in Paris, FR and Copenhagen, DK, where I had the pleasure of&nbsp;running into him late one night. He's made a trip over to play in Berlin recently and has been doing the rounds in the US. Without further ado, here are his five songs:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#000000;">1) Newworldaquarium &#8211; Avon Sparkle</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#000000;"></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#000000;">Could have been so many tracks coming from NWAQ (NY, Trespassers), he is really one of a kind in making loops that are still exciting after 6 min.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#000000;">2) Gigi Galaxy &#8211; The Dream</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#000000;"></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#000000;">In a similar vibe, a track that could go on forever and seems still so fresh after 20 years (1994!)</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#000000;">3) The Railway Raver &#8211; Yes I Can Feel I<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">t</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#000000;"></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#000000;"><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">I have a soft spot for happy/emo slow juno/acid tracks and that is definitely one of my favorites coming from a guy who only released 3-4 records unfortunately. </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#000000;"><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">4) X men &#8211; Retour aux pyramides</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#000000;"></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#000000;"><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">an all time french rap classic, that was on the soundtrack of "Ma 6-T Va Crack-er" </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#000000;"><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">5) AFX &#8211; Mangle 11</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#000000;"></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#000000;"><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Just because this track is marvelously insane, and also for a subtle use of a Pierre Schaeffer sample in the middle/later part of the track.</span></span>
