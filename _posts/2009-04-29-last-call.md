  <p>
    okaay this is as far as I got<br />hope you folks dug this on some level and it wasn’t entirely masturbatory (not that kwur has any problem with that kind of stuff, I know I know…)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    for the whole thing, <a href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/labels/folk%20stacks%20guide.html">click here</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">TOM RUSSELL – THE LONG WAY AROUND</span><br />singersongwriter writes california country music<br />with a penchant for overwrought, literate, plain overwritten story-songs<br />(and of course I find this endearing, though you might not)<br />that’s what country music is all about!<br />Lots of juicy details, place names<br />some of his albums (all concept-albums, naturally) can be difficult to slog through and digest<br />for instance, his bukowski references, song suites, poorly pronounced spanish (there’s a song here about uh pancho villa and zapata uh I think maybe)<br />this sampler is great, though<br />almost all of these are duets, which disguises his limited vocal range<br />talent abounds: nanci griffith, iris dement, jimmie dale gilmore (and those second two are two of my favorite singers ever)<br />“mineral wells” is fucking brilliant – about a washed-up, homeless former celeb actress and an obese film critic who drive out to the texas desert in search of immortality<br />many other songs come close<br />at least look at the picture of him with andy warhol and george jones in the liner notes wtf<br />
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">THE SKILLET LICKERS – OLD TIME FIDDLE TUNES AND SONGS FROM NORTH GEORGIA</span><br />the lickers played fiddle tunes when honestly most tunes were fiddle tunes<br />before “country music”<br />granted, their name was supposed to sound as exaggerated and redneck as it does (tapping into that hillbilly market, naturally), but these folks were the real deal as far as musicianship goes<br />when folks want to hear music that vibes on that “old-timey” stuff, up to their neck in npr-ready “o brother” knockoffs (remember that?), this is what they should seek out<br />these are catchy and funny – I would recommend the skillet lickers any day over, say, fiddlin’ john carson (the true first hillbilly hitmaker), whose recordings were perhaps more authentic, but also way longer and mostly very boring<br />“sal’s gone to the cider mill”<br />“hell broke loose in georgia”<br />
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />HANK THOMPSON – SEVEN DECADES</span><br />by the time the year 2000 rolled around and hank thompson recorded this record, he definitely couldn’t croon as hot as he had in the 1960s height of his popularity, but oh boy he wouldn’t let that get to him<br />as he says himself—<br />“if there’s honey in that hive<br />there’s a sting in this old bee<br />I may not buzz as often<br />or as loud as I used to do<br />but I’d love a taste of that nectar<br />from a pretty little flower like you”<br />yeah exactly<br />like any hank thompson album, this record’s a nice mix of lightweight honkytonk and western swing, filled out with novelty songs (which become increasingly difficult to distinguish from the serious cuts)<br />he flirts with tejano on “condo in hondo” for instance<br />it’s always nice when aging stars don’t stoop to playing up their age in order to boost serious dynamic/gravitas (i.e. the rick rubin cash treatment)<br />hank’s voice was mostly intact, so why not use it for what it does best?
  </p>

  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">HANK WILLIAMS – ALONE WITH HIS GUITAR</span><br />of course ol’ hank’s the most famous country singer of them all<br />every Nash wannabe with a rhinestone-speckled guitar strap just hasta give him props or else…<br />first (not quite, okay. see: jimmie rodgers) legit POP honky-tonk/hillbilly hero/martyr (died in ’53 slumped over in his cadillac et cetera)<br />vocal stylings perfect marriage of Tubb’s throaty sneer and Acuff polite yelp (this amalgam is something he cultivated, admittedly)<br />a wowee zowee genuine singer-songwriter – no-frills, heartfelt stories<br />lots of heartbreak and doom, but he is unafraid of cheese and f-u-n (read lots of romance comics, from whence he derived many lyrics- true story!)<br />this collection is maybe a good intro for those of ya afraid of Country with a capital C – these are rawer and folkier than the famous full band cuts (sound quality varies, obv)<br />listen to this album, anyone & everyone!<br />(kaw-liga is the saddest song I’ve ever heard about people who are made out of wood and not actually people)<br />
  </p>

  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">LUCINDA WILLIAMS – CAR WHEELS ON A GRAVEL ROAD</span><br />once upon a time she was the next great hope for country music, songwriters, “honest music”<br />(alas, for those who’ve caught her recent rawk albums, esp. brand new “honey bee,” this has not proven to still be the case)<br />this is evidence of that early winning charm and talent<br />attention to detail!<br />her phlegmy snarl sounds so good<br />she works in rockabilly fake yodels, voice cracks (in track 5, for instance) and gets away with it where lesser talents have not<br />this album (to me) is all about the power of location-specific songwriting<br />with regards to that, dig track 6: “lake charles,” which maybe makes me want to cry a little bit every time I hear it (also, “jackson”)
  </p>
  
  <p>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    at the end of the list there’s a postscript from when I ran out of time/gave up–<br />it says: DON’T FORGET – HANDSOME FAMILY<br />KOERNER, RAY AND GLOVER<br />WAYNE HANCOCK<br />GEORGE JONES<br />ELIZABETH COTTON<br />IRIS DEMENT
  </p>
  
  <p>
    so here goes, sans commentary (phew)…
