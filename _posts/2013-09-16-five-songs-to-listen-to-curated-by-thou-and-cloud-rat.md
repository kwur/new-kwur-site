    We caught up with New Orleans sludge metal dudebros THOU (with special guest Rorick of CLOUD RAT) after their show at Fubar yesterday, and decided that they would be our guinea pigs for our new blog feature, FIVE SONGS TO LISTEN TO. As you may have guessed, we ask various persons/musicians/friends to list five songs that they think everyone should hear.
