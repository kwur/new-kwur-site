    I’ve spoken highly of Athens, GA based Bar-B-Q Killers <a href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/2009/05/atlanta-ga-insideout-full-length.html">before</a>. Well, it seems that someone (Mike Turner and Gordon Lamb) has finally stepped up to get their one and only album, <span style="font-style: italic;">Comely</span>, properly remastered and reissued (with bonus tracks too).

    I guess this project is dependent on raising some money first. You can donate/pre-order <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/63732338/bring-the-bar-b-q-killers-album-back-to-life">here</a>. It looks like the goal is to get it out on CD, and if enough money is raised, possibly even vinyl. Vinyl, Vinyl, Vinyl!

    Thankfully, I tracked down two original LPs both for extremely reasonable prices. I found one from a seller in Washington state on ebay and one at a used record store in Los Angeles. Both quite far from the Athens/Atlanta homebase. For a while, I even considered reissuing the LP on bootleg cassette. Glad I don’t have to because someone’s doing it legitimately.

    KWUR also has the <span style="font-style: italic;">Athens, GA: Inside/Out</span> soundtrack LP. Pretty rad BBQ Killers live track on that one..

    And just to get you excited, here’s a clip of the Bar-B-Q Killers from that very film (directed by KWUR alum, <a href="http://www.studlife.com/cadenza/2009/10/30/interview-with-bill-cody/">Bill Cody</a>)…<br />
