  <p>
    Last Friday we had the pleasure to have Joe Stickley and Sean Canan in the station for a live set on-the-air. They played a few songs off their new album <a href="http://blog.kwur.com/2010/07/album-review-joe-stickley-and-sean.html"><span style="font-style:italic;">Loaded to the Gunwales</span></a> as well as an old favorite and a brand new Levellers cover. As always, you can see them on Sunday nights at McGurkâ€™s in Soulard.

    The whole session will be rebroadcast this Thursday at 4:30pm! A few clips are below.
