    They’ll also be in town at Blue Hill at the Duck Room on <span style="font-weight: bold;">May 27th</span>. They last stopped by St. Louis in 2005 to celebrate the release of Gold (which was a collaboration with Trans Am). Don’t miss this show (you will get rocked)…and stay tuned to KWUR to hear the brand new Champs tunes!
