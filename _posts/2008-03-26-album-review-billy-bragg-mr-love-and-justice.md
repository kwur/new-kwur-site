Not the most striking album maybe, but the instrumentation is nice, the songs are driving, wry and witty and Bragg&#8217;s smart, rich brogue is reminiscent of Morrissey here. Billy Bragg is barely to the right of Lenin, and his lyrics often reflect that, which can be annoying, but mostly it&#8217;s ok.
