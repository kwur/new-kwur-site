This album tries to strike a balance between the Minneapolis Rhymesayers Brother Ali sound and NY street grind and mostly fails, largely due to lethargic rhymes and indifferent beats. Other people might like this. By the way, when&#8217;s the Memphis Bleek album coming out?

    7 has the most hooks and the most on-vacation Raekwon verse you ever wanted to hear.

    BUT, if you really like hip-hop, I know you&#8217;re going to come out to see the LEGENDARY Sadat X on Friday the 19th. <a href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/2010/02/kwur-week-2010-feb-17th-20th-rah-rah.html">Rah KWUR Week!</a>
