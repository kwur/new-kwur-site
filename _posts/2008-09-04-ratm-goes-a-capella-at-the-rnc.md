    &#8220;Rage Against the Machine showed up to perform a show outside of the Minnesota State Capitol for the Ripple Effect music festival on Tuesday, but the concert was shut down. The band was set to perform at 6:30P, however police denied the band access to the stage.&#8221;<a name='more'></a>

    In response, the group delivered an a capella version of &#8220;Bulls on Parade.&#8221; &#8230;
