    <img class="aligncenter" title="Pirate Fucking Radio" src="http://bandcamp.com/files/35/25/3525816715-1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="350" />We&#8217;ve just delved deep into the KWUR computers and posted many of our past Stack Sessions online. Some were posted previously, but this is the first appearance for several bands such as <a href="http://kwur.bandcamp.com/album/pirate-fucking-radio-stack-session">Pirate Fucking Radio</a>, <a href="http://kwur.bandcamp.com/album/hermit-thrushes-stack-session">Hermit Thrushes</a>, and <a href="http://kwur.bandcamp.com/album/electric-tickle-machine-stack-session">Electric Tickle Machine</a>. You may freely stream all sessions or download them at your leisure. Scan down the list on the right side of your screen for the full list of available bands.

    The Stack Session series has been a learning experience for all involved, and we humbly submit our recordings to you, warts and all. These recordings are not professional; they merely offer an informal glimpse into these bands&#8217; music. Thanks to Kenny Hofmeister for spending many, many hours recording most of these bands.

    Keep your eyes open. More sessions will be added soon!
