It was what I would call a truly catchy song, a.k.a. I was already singing along midway through the first chorus. The song had a somewhat cryptic title, and I didn’t really understand what the lyrics meant, but I didn’t care at all. It was just a really good rockin’ pop song called “Brasil, 1957.”

    Upon further research at <a href="http://www.beltstl.com/2009/08/architecture-rock-st-louis-style/">BeltSTL.com</a>, I discovered that the title and lyrics reference the architecture and 1957 construction of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Bras%C3%ADlia">Brasilia</a>, the capital of Brasil. This city has some awesome futuristic buildings and the entire city was actually laid out in the <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&om=1&z=12&ll=-15.79787,-47.896271&spn=0.143704,0.233459&t=k">shape of an airplane</a>. How cool is that?

    I guess the first moral of the story is that it’s ok to like songs on multiple levels. The second moral is that the Blind Eyes are a really awesome band located right here in St. Louis, MO. And they are not playing your average pop song.
