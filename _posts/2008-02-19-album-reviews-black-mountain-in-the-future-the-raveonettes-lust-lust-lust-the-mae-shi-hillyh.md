    Black Mountain &#8211; &#8220;In The Future&#8221;<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/Black-Mountain-II-747900.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/Black-Mountain-II-747889.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>This freak-folk hard rock album sounds like what you thought rock should sound like when you were a 13 year old boy &#8211; balls-out, sweet riffs, killer drums, &#8220;And they called it Stonehenge&#8230;&#8221; As such, there&#8217;s a bit here that smacks of Lynyrd Skynyrd reactionary rock, but usually it&#8217;s just weird enough so you can rock out without shame.

    Play: 1++, 2, 3++++(KICK ASS), 5, 6++(Sabbath!), 8+, 9++(Neat)

    The Raveonettes &#8211; &#8220;Lust Lust Lust&#8221;<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/raveonettes_20122005_top-791782.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/raveonettes_20122005_top-791776.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>The Raveonettes are still basically just the best Jesus And Mary Chain cover band out there, and it&#8217;s frustrating to see them succeed without progressing one iota stylistically. Still, I&#8217;ll be damned if they can&#8217;t write a beautiful song with little more than amp fuzz and Sharin Foo&#8217;s bell-like voice. If you let it, this album will break your heart.

  <p>
    Play: 3, 4, 6+, 7+, 9++, 10+++(sweet bass line, percussion), 12 and 13+++ (will rip your heart out of your fucking chest)

    The Mae Shi &#8211; &#8220;Hillyh&#8221;<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/maeshi-794233.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/maeshi-794228.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Energetic, chanty, melodic LA indie pop that combines the sing-a-long playfulness of Architecture In Helsinki with the quirkiness and inventiveness of The Fiery Furnaces. Like your friends are having a beer and pizza party in your ear &#8211; great fun!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Play: 1++(vocal melody!), 2++++(lyrics awesome!), 3+++(Rawk), 4++, 5, 7, 8+, 9++ (sing along, kids), 11, 14++(sweet)
