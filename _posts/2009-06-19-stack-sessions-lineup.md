    Here&#8217;s the line-up for Stack Sessions OH NINE, as promised:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    June:<br />21 &#8211; Telekinesis!<br />24 &#8211; CJ Chenier // So Many Dynamos<br />25 &#8211; Benyaro<br />26 &#8211; The Features
  </p>
  
  <p>
    July:<br />5 &#8211; The Paper Chase<br />11 &#8211; These United States<br />24 &#8211; Those Darlins
  </p>
  
  <p>
    August:<br />3 &#8211; Casper & The Cookies
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Okay so that seems a bit sparse, BUT, it&#8217;s pretty fluid &#8211; new shows are announced all the time, and we&#8217;re working on getting a lot of local acts in as well. Needless to say, this is just the beginning &#8211; stay tuned for more announcements in the coming days and weeks (it&#8217;s like a big 3 month long music festival!). Also, keep your eye out for postings of interviews and instudios past.
