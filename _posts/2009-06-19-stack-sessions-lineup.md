  <p>
    Here’s the line-up for Stack Sessions OH NINE, as promised:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    June:<br />21 – Telekinesis!<br />24 – CJ Chenier // So Many Dynamos<br />25 – Benyaro<br />26 – The Features
  </p>
  
  <p>
    July:<br />5 – The Paper Chase<br />11 – These United States<br />24 – Those Darlins
  </p>
  
  <p>
    August:<br />3 – Casper & The Cookies
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Okay so that seems a bit sparse, BUT, it’s pretty fluid – new shows are announced all the time, and we’re working on getting a lot of local acts in as well. Needless to say, this is just the beginning – stay tuned for more announcements in the coming days and weeks (it’s like a big 3 month long music festival!). Also, keep your eye out for postings of interviews and instudios past.
