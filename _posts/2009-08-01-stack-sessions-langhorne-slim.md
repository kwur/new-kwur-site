  <p>
    Aaaand we&#8217;re back. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/langhorneslim">Langhorne Slim</a> played a sold-out show with Josh Ritter at Off Broadway this week, but before he took the stage he dropped by our humble station to lay down a few tracks. They&#8217;re all cuts from his new album <a href="http://www.kemado.com/artists.php?req=show&artist=21">&#8220;Be Set Free&#8221;</a> &#8211; out September 29th on Kemado &#8211; and they&#8217;re acoustic. This, in itself, is pretty cool; Mr. Slim has filled out his sound with more instrumentation throughout the past few releases, and when you hear these songs on the album, they won&#8217;t sound quite like this (as is, they sound great). So whether you&#8217;re a fan of the newer stuff or the older stuff, you&#8217;ll probably dig these. Thanks again to Langhorne and crew for hanging out!
