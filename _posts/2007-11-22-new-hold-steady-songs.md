    Tonight at the Hold Steady, Art Brut, 1990s show, the Hold Steady at Terminal 5 in New York, played 3 new songs: Stay Positive, Ask Her For Adderall, and another one I didn&#8217;t catch the name of (it had Strange in it). The first two were pretty fast and the third was pretty slow. All three: pretty awesome.

    For the Hold Steady&#8217;s last song, Art Brut&#8217;s Eddie Argos and Ian Catskilkin joined them on stage. I&#8217;ll try to post some video when I find it, but let me just tell you, the British accent brings a whole new element to the Hold Steady. Whether that&#8217;s a good thing, I&#8217;m not too sure. But Jackie McKeown of 1990s (who put on another great, great, great performance) was dancing along with the entire set (including the 30 seconds of Art Brut&#8217;s Hold Steady cameo) also, so you know the set itself had to be good.
