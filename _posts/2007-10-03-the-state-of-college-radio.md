    This is from CMJ’s chart recap, posted today:

    “Adds saw a few surprises, as <strong>Stars</strong> went most added at both Radio 200 and Triple A, beating out <strong>Jens Lekman</strong> (No. 2), the <strong>Foo Fighters</strong> (No. 4) and Motion City Soundtrack (No. 5).”

    Isn’t the point of college radio to play things that aren’t heard elsewhere? The surprise isn’t that Stars, a pretty major indie-rock band, beat out the Foo Fighters and Motion City Soundtrack, it’s that self-respecting college radio stations actually added the Foo Fighters and Motion City Soundtrack. All I can say is laaaaaaaaaaame.
