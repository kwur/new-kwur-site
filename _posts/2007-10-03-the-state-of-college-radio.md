    This is from CMJ&#8217;s chart recap, posted today:

    &#8220;Adds saw a few surprises, as <strong>Stars</strong> went most added at both Radio 200 and Triple A, beating out <strong>Jens Lekman</strong> (No. 2), the <strong>Foo Fighters</strong> (No. 4) and Motion City Soundtrack (No. 5).&#8221;

    Isn&#8217;t the point of college radio to play things that aren&#8217;t heard elsewhere? The surprise isn&#8217;t that Stars, a pretty major indie-rock band, beat out the Foo Fighters and Motion City Soundtrack, it&#8217;s that self-respecting college radio stations actually added the Foo Fighters and Motion City Soundtrack. All I can say is laaaaaaaaaaame.
