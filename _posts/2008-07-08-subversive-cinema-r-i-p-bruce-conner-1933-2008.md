    <span id="bodytext" class="georgia md">&#8220;Bruce Conner, a San Francisco artist renowned for working fluently across media, died at his home of natural causes on Monday. He was 74&#8230;</p> 
    
    <p>
      &#8230;</span><span id="bodytext" class="georgia md">Mr. Conner first got noticed for the short films he assembled from scavenged documentary and B-movie footage. Several of his films, including &#8220;A Movie&#8221; (1958), a sort of paean to human failure, and &#8220;Crossroads&#8221; (1977), are regarded as classics of independent filmmaking, even though Mr. Conner shot no original footage for them&#8230;</span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      &#8230;<span id="bodytext" class="georgia md">Mr. Conner announced his own death erroneously on two occasions, once sending an obituary to a national art magazine, and later writing a self-description for the biographical encyclopedia Who Was Who in America.&#8221;</p>
