      Huerco S. is an electronic music producer/DJ based in Kansas City who's been steadily releasing material over the past few years on labels such as Wicked Bass, Opal Tapes, Future Times, and Prohibito. His work has been gaining notice from the underground electronic music community, appearing in online publications Resident Advisor and XLR8R. KWUR was lucky enough to have him perform a DJ set in the Gargoyle for the KWUR Week 2013 Electronic Showcase. In case you missed out on that, I asked him to put together a mix that I played on my show last month. Included in the mix are some of Huerco's own tracks that will be released on his first LP due out later this year. Since he's such a nice dude, I also asked Huerco a few questions to go along with the mix. Check it out and enjoy!

      <strong>Describe your sound in two words</strong><br /> Huerco S.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>What&rsquo;s your production process like?</strong><br /> Ritually turning mundane tasks into something of great purpose. I'm always drawing parallels between the act of making music and the act of, let's say building an earthen mound. The repetitive nature of the work is something I enjoy.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>How did you get in to electronic music?</strong><br /> During high school I was mostly listening to hardcore/noise/punk and eventually got burnt out on that really aggressive sound. The soulful and upbeat nature of drum & bass and jungle made a great segue.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>What are some of your influences, musically or otherwise?</strong><br /> Pre-Columbian America and Kansas City Jazz.

    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>What are you looking forward to for the second half of 2013?</strong><br /> Touring is a big one for me. I'll be heading to Europe for the first time this June, so excited. Also looking forward to working in collaboration with some friends. We'll see.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>You&rsquo;ve got a full-length album coming out sometime soon. How&rsquo;s that production been compared to releasing EPs?</strong><br /> For this particular release I wanted to showcase a more "experimental" side to my production. I really admire people like Rene Pawlowitz aka Shed. His full lengths are absolutely mental and all over the place, yet his EPs generally consist of dancefloor related material. I just want to do it all and I don't see any reason why I can't.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>How is it being based in KC? What&rsquo;s the scene like?</strong><br /> It's lovely really. Rent is ridiculously cheap, so just in the fact I don't have to work 60hrs a week to survive allows me time to work. The city itself is always a source of inspiration, the architecture, the isolation. As far as a scene goes it's just me and my friends.

      <strong>What have you been listening to recently / releases you&rsquo;re looking forward to?</strong><br /> My taste lately has been really reflective of the weather (crisp, bouncy, warm, angular, gleaming). Really been lovely Funkineven's NTS radio shows, stoked for the Kyle Hall LP, been listening to a lot of New Musik.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>You&rsquo;ve had digital, vinyl, and cassette releases so far. How&rsquo;s that experience been and do you have any preference? </strong><br /> Digital and cassette are good in there own right, but I really only prefer to release on vinyl from here on out. I do believe however there will be a CD accompaniment to the 2xLP coming out this summer. I just love the tactile relationship you can have with a record. Never really felt that with digital or tapes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Weirdest or most exotic place you&rsquo;ve performed so far?</strong><br /> Haha California is pretty exotic for me, just got back a couple weeks ago&#8230;such a trip. I played packed in a laundry room in Montreal, that was pretty insane.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>You&rsquo;ve released under the alias &ldquo;Royal Crown of Sweden,&rdquo; aka &ldquo;R.C.O.S.&rdquo; Any plans for a &ldquo;H.U.E.&rdquo; release? Any different approach when releasing under an alias?</strong><br /> Hahaha you caught that. Wasn't sure if anyone would get it. Yeah I generally use an alias as a break or departure from what I'm currently doing. So for the RCOS stuff i really just wanted to make House tracks and I felt like that wouldn't necessarily fit as Huerco S.

      <strong>If you had a time machine when and where would you go?</strong><br /> 1340s North America, would be lovely just to walk around and experiencing this massive continent free from our corruption.
