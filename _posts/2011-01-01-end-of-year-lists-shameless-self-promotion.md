    Btw, you guyz, if you liked my <a href="http://kwur.com/the-intern-my-year-in-music">end-of-year post</a>, I just posted an essay about the soul musician Syl Johnson and a bad Pitchfork Review (and Jay-Z's autobiography, and the RZA, among other things) up on a group blog I contribute to, <a href="http://likethemthatdream.wordpress.com">Like Them That Dream</a>. So if you like my thoughts on music and stuff, check it out.
