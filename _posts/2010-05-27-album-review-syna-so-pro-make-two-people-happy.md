    St. Louis local <a href="http://www.myspace.com/synasoloproject">Syna So Pro</a>, a.k.a. Syrhea Conaway, is a self proclaimed &#8220;one woman musical enigma.&#8221; She lives up to the title by making experimental symphonic pop by looping vocals, synths, guitar, bass, violin, and beats into a soaring, ethereal landscape. Her newest album <span style="font-style:italic;">Make Two People Happy</span> works best when played VERY LOUD and in it&#8217;s entirety, but here are a few highlights for radio play. Check out a bouncy little number, &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alPeTiR0BjQ">Santhem</a>&#8220;, and a nice rocker with swirling vocal, &#8220;If You Really Want It&#8221;. Finally, &#8220;All The Time&#8221; is a bit of a firework show to cap off the album with all her best tricks.
