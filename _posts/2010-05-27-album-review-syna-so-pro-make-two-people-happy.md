    St. Louis local <a href="http://www.myspace.com/synasoloproject">Syna So Pro</a>, a.k.a. Syrhea Conaway, is a self proclaimed “one woman musical enigma.” She lives up to the title by making experimental symphonic pop by looping vocals, synths, guitar, bass, violin, and beats into a soaring, ethereal landscape. Her newest album <span style="font-style:italic;">Make Two People Happy</span> works best when played VERY LOUD and in it’s entirety, but here are a few highlights for radio play. Check out a bouncy little number, “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alPeTiR0BjQ">Santhem</a>“, and a nice rocker with swirling vocal, “If You Really Want It”. Finally, “All The Time” is a bit of a firework show to cap off the album with all her best tricks.
