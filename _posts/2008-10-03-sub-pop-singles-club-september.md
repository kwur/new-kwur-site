    <p>
      Everyone&#8217;s favorite Seattle institution, Sub Pop records, re-established their well known singles club to celebrate their 20 anniversary. For $75, 1500 lucky subscribers will receive a special 7inch 45rpm record every month for one year. I&#8217;ll review them all right here on the KWUR Blog.

    My September 7-inch arrived late in the month. I was surprised to see the vinyl was &#8220;Jolly Rancher Sour Apple&#8221; green this time, instead of the beige color of the August OM single. This month, Sub Pop treated us to some of their own hometown punk with four (appropriately short) tracks by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Unnatural Helpers</span>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Dirty Dumb & Comical&#8221;, &#8220;Connecting&#8221; b/w &#8220;Break That Horse&#8221;, &#8220;Easy Way&#8221;<br /></span><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/unnatural-740330.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 235px; height: 238px;" src="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/unnatural-740308.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />I don&#8217;t know much about the Unnatural Helpers, but they are a self-described &#8220;punk band from Seattle, Washington.&#8221; I think that&#8217;s pretty much all you need to know.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    They have a surprisingly clean yet Seattle heavy sound that can&#8217;t be described as anything but &#8220;punk&#8221;. No &#8220;Pop Punk,&#8221; &#8220;Post-Punk,&#8221; or &#8220;Hardcore,&#8221; &#8212; just simple short northwestern punk.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    All songs clock in under two minutes, but it&#8217;s another strong effort. The opening &#8220;Dirty Dumb & Comical&#8221; is probably the best track with heavy riffs and drum fills, and minimal dryly delivered lyrics. The next two tracks (&#8220;Connecting&#8221; and &#8220;Break That Horse&#8221;) stick with this tried and true formula.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But, the closing track, &#8220;Easy Way,&#8221; is the divergent one here. The Helpers slow it down a bit and focus more on their heavy sound &#8211; a sound that gladly falls right in line with the celebrated Seattle underground.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And finally, it&#8217;s nice to see that Sub Pop has added a little emblem on the back above their logo. It simply reads: &#8220;Singles Club, Sep 2008, Edition of 1,500.&#8221; An appreciated move for all the record collectors out there.

    I can only hope the October issue is on orange vinyl&#8230;
