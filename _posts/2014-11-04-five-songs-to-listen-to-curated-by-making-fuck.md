    SLC doom trio MAKING FUCK are set to release their debut full-length "A Harrowing End" this upcoming spring. I was fortunately enough to grab a list of five songs to listen to from guitarist/cool guy Kory Quist – it's a sick list, so please check it out!

    "five songs to listen to"
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Shit. this is going to be a hard one. When I think about this question it reminds me of one of my favorite movies – High Fidelity with Jon Cusack. He gets asked a question about his top five favorite albums, and can't come up with a straight answer, only more questions like: when, at home? in the club? .. and so on'<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">.</span>

    I guess what I'll do is five songs that are helping me reflect as the winter gets closer and the dawn of a new year is at hand.<br data-reactid=".4h.$mid=11414213120220=2d3c0825e1ee6dc5f54.2:0.0.0.0.0.0.$end:0:$5:0" /><br /> <br data-reactid=".4h.$mid=11414213120220=2d3c0825e1ee6dc5f54.2:0.0.0.0.0.0.$end:0:$7:0" /><br /> Number 1:

    Airport by Karate.

    <br data-reactid=".4h.$mid=11414213120220=2d3c0825e1ee6dc5f54.2:0.0.0.0.0.0.$end:0:$11:0" /><br /> This band is one of my most favorite bands to always listen to. But this particular track reminds of the days before jadedness set in, and my friends and I all still had big dreams of being something some day. It makes me think about all the friends that have come and gone. but mostly the ones I'm still friends with. I love it when i get to hang out with some old faces I've known for a decade or more. Feeling that comfortable is.. well, comforting.<br data-reactid=".4h.$mid=11414213120220=2d3c0825e1ee6dc5f54.2:0.0.0.0.0.0.$end:0:$13:0" /><br /> <br data-reactid=".4h.$mid=11414213120220=2d3c0825e1ee6dc5f54.2:0.0.0.0.0.0.$end:0:$15:0" /><br /> Number 2:

    Micheal by sadistik

    This song is about Sadistik finding his dear friend Micheal "Eyedea" Larson dead from a drug overdose.<br data-reactid=".4h.$mid=11414213120220=2d3c0825e1ee6dc5f54.2:0.0.0.0.0.0.$end:0:$21:0" /><br /> Any art that is sincerely an imitation of someone's life, I seem to gravitate towards. This song in particular really caught my attention. I like a lot of what this dude does. but this song and the spoken word at the end really hits me hard in trying to understand the world, people, and myself.<br data-reactid=".4h.$mid=11414213120220=2d3c0825e1ee6dc5f54.2:0.0.0.0.0.0.$end:0:$23:0" /><br /> <br data-reactid=".4h.$mid=11414213120220=2d3c0825e1ee6dc5f54.2:0.0.0.0.0.0.$end:0:$25:0" /><br /> Number 3:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Great Cessation -YOB<br /> <br data-reactid=".4h.$mid=11414213120220=2d3c0825e1ee6dc5f54.2:0.0.0.0.0.0.$end:0:$29:0" /><br /> The progression of this great band amazes me every time I rock any one of their records. You know Mike is a true artist, which I love. I feel like you get a much more intimate connection with YOB with each record. My dad used to talk about the "classics" when I was young. Well dad, this band is a fucking classic!<br data-reactid=".4h.$mid=11414213120220=2d3c0825e1ee6dc5f54.2:0.0.0.0.0.0.$end:0:$31:0" /><br /> <br data-reactid=".4h.$mid=11414213120220=2d3c0825e1ee6dc5f54.2:0.0.0.0.0.0.$end:0:$33:0" /><br /> Number 4:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Untitled Love Song by The Angel</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">s Of Light.</span><br /> <br data-reactid=".4h.$mid=11414213120220=2d3c0825e1ee6dc5f54.2:0.0.0.0.0.0.$end:0:$35:0" /><br /> <br data-reactid=".4h.$mid=11414213120220=2d3c0825e1ee6dc5f54.2:0.0.0.0.0.0.$end:0:$37:0" /><br /> We play loud heavy emotional music in what I thought was rebellion, but I think we are all hopeless romantics in the end, influenced by stories and movies about "true love" with happy endings. We crave this non-realist movie ending that is never going to happen. This song helps me realize that my existence is nothing compared to life as a whole.<br data-reactid=".4h.$mid=11414213120220=2d3c0825e1ee6dc5f54.2:0.0.0.0.0.0.$end:0:$39:0" /><br /> <br data-reactid=".4h.$mid=11414213120220=2d3c0825e1ee6dc5f54.2:0.0.0.0.0.0.$end:0:$41:0" /><br /> Number 5:<br /> Mongrel by Cult Leader

This song speaks so loudly to me. These dudes defiantly pushing the norm. Thanks for being inspiring to a dead scene .
