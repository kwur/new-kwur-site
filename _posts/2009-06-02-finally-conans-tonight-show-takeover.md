  <p>
    It&#8217;s time for Conan O&#8217;Brien to take over the &#8220;Tonight Show.&#8221; Finally, I can go to bed an hour earlier and still catch the best show in late night television.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This all started back in 2004, when NBC feared Conan, who had the highest 12:30 slot ratings, would jump to another network and take his coveted male 18-35 demographic with him. So, against all odds, they promised him the Tonight Show five years in advance while seemingly pushing Jay Leno into retirement.

  <p>
    Of course, Mediocrity (however, I hear his &#8220;real&#8221; stand-up is good) refused to leave and he&#8217;ll still be on at 10pm for all the old folks who just don&#8217;t get Conan. Why does Leno suck so much? I think the AV Club pretty much <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/does-anyone-remember-jay-lenos-most-memorable-mome,28567/">nailed it</a>.

    Things to look for on the new Tonight Show:<br />&#8211; A brand new sophisticated art-deco set (in Universal City the next building over from where I used to work!) referencing his old home at 30 Rockefeller center. Don&#8217;t worry, Conan reassures us that “You can still be a jackass in an elegant space.”<br />&#8211; A set of jokes about Conan&#8217;s awkward transition life in L.A. This should be good, especially for those who&#8217;ve lived in L.A. before.<br />&#8211; Andy Richter: he&#8217;s back!

    And as a little preview, one of my favorite Conan sketches. Dinner with producer Jordan Slansky:<br />
