  <p>
    It’s time for Conan O’Brien to take over the “Tonight Show.” Finally, I can go to bed an hour earlier and still catch the best show in late night television.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This all started back in 2004, when NBC feared Conan, who had the highest 12:30 slot ratings, would jump to another network and take his coveted male 18-35 demographic with him. So, against all odds, they promised him the Tonight Show five years in advance while seemingly pushing Jay Leno into retirement.

  <p>
    Of course, Mediocrity (however, I hear his “real” stand-up is good) refused to leave and he’ll still be on at 10pm for all the old folks who just don’t get Conan. Why does Leno suck so much? I think the AV Club pretty much <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/does-anyone-remember-jay-lenos-most-memorable-mome,28567/">nailed it</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Things to look for on the new Tonight Show:<br />– A brand new sophisticated art-deco set (in Universal City the next building over from where I used to work!) referencing his old home at 30 Rockefeller center. Don’t worry, Conan reassures us that “You can still be a jackass in an elegant space.”<br />– A set of jokes about Conan’s awkward transition life in L.A. This should be good, especially for those who’ve lived in L.A. before.<br />– Andy Richter: he’s back!

    And as a little preview, one of my favorite Conan sketches. Dinner with producer Jordan Slansky:<br />
