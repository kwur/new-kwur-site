  <p>
    &#8220;Finding Your Animal Totem
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1. This exercise is best performed outside, in Nature, for it is there,<br />after all, that the animals reside. If you can manage it, take your drum<br />with you and travel deep into the woods. Find an isolated spot to sit.<br />Bring a blanket or mat to sit on if that makes you more comfortable.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are many, however, who live in the city and do not have ready<br />access to the great outdoors. Don&#8217;t worry about it; this exercise can<br />easily be practiced indoors as well. All you really need is some room to<br />move and a place to sit.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As you sit, you may wonder which way to face. There are, in fact, many<br />shamanic traditions about the four cardinal directions. The west serves<br />as the direction of transformation, death and rebirth. The east, as the<br />opposite direction, represents all the opposite qualities. The north is<br />commonly regarded as a difficult direction; it is from the north that<br />the winter snows descend upon humankind to chill the earth. The opposite<br />direction, south, is symbolic of abundance and fertility.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The answer to our question, then, is to face any direction you please,<br />though east or south would be preferable.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are working outdoors at night, you may wish to focus your gaze<br />upon the North Star. If you live in the city and are working indoors,<br />you can simply visualize the North Star shining above your head. The<br />easiest way to find the North Star is to look for the Big Dipper. You<br />probably know where it is already, for it is one of the best-known and<br />most easily identifiable constellations in the heavens. Now focus on the<br />Dipper&#8217;s bowl. Note the end of the bowl farthest from the handle, and<br />follow its line to the top or rim of the bowl. Then keep following the<br />same line with your eyes until you reach the next star. This is Polaris,<br />the North Star. You will know you&#8217;ve located it correctly if the star<br />you&#8217;re gazing at forms the top of the handle of yet another dipper&#8211;the<br />Little Dipper.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    2. Indoors or out, begin this exercise with drumming. Drum slowly and<br />rhythmically at first. If you can work with a partner, so much the<br />better. Let your partner do the drumming for you, the better to focus<br />your own concentration.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As you feel yourself become part of the drumbeat, build up your inner<br />World Tree in your imagination. Breathe in and out with deep and<br />constant rhythm that harmonizes with the drumbeat. Breathing in, draw<br />the energy up from the earth to the topmost branches of the tree;<br />breathing out, circulate the energy back into the earth.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    3. When you feel fully empowered with the energy of your own Internal<br />World Tree, stand up and increase the pace of the drumbeat.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are working alone, you may need to get the hang of holding and<br />beating your drum while moving around. Moving and drumming all at once<br />may seem awkward at first, but Native American shamans do it all time.<br />Of course, if you are working with a partner, you won&#8217;t have this<br />problem; and when you stand up you will be signaling your partner than<br />you are ready to dance, and that the pace of the drumming should<br />increase.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you genuinely feel that dancing with drum in hand is likely to cramp<br />your style, and if your powers of imagination and will are sufficient to<br />keep the drumbeat pounding in your head without the aid of the physical<br />instrument, then by all means you may set down the drum at this<br />juncture.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    4. Move around the room, or around the outdoor space you have selected,<br />in a circular motion. For this kind of work, always move in a clockwise<br />direction. Walking in the path of the sun symbolizes increase and<br />beneficence, while moving counter-sun wise produces the opposite effect.<br />As you move, feel free to use any kind of footsteps you please, but try<br />to keep your movements more or less in time with the drumming. If<br />someone else is drumming for you, or if you feel sufficiently confident<br />to work without the drum, then you can use your hands as well.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As you dance, mentally call upon all the world&#8217;s creatures to be with<br />you in your circle. Send forth a voice from your mind, and see the sound<br />waves traveling out through the universe. You will soon begin to sense<br />the presence of the animal powers, to feel wings brush against your<br />body, to hear the birdsong and the howling of wolves or coyotes, the<br />neighing of horses, the scream of the jaguar&#8211;all the sounds and<br />sensations of the animal kingdom.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    5. As you dance in a circle, surrounded by the animal powers, be aware<br />of how your footwork changes, and be aware of your hands and arms, if<br />you&#8217;re using them. You will take on a particular gait, a particular<br />stance, a particular set of motions. These movements are characteristic<br />of your animal, whose presence you will now begin to feel.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When an animal has fully established itself within you, let it dance in<br />your spirit for a while. Then, stop dancing. Stand still until your<br />breathing is slow and rhythmic once again. Welcome your animal into your<br />soul.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Be open minded as to what animal you receive, albeit the biggest or<br />cutest or trendiest critter, isn&#8217;t necessarily the most powerful animal<br />for you. In European lore, the little mouse was the spirit traveler par<br />excellence, and hence an animal of great power. Don&#8217;t try to bend the<br />powers of the animal kingdom to your will, just let your animal come to<br />you. Your animal totem may change over time, anyway, or you may find<br />yourself hosting more than one.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Don&#8217;t intellectualize about the qualities attributed to different<br />animals-by doing so, you will only end up choosing an animal image of<br />how you want to be, rather than finding the totem you really need. You<br />can go read about you animal totem after you&#8217;ve found it. You may still<br />wish to examine some of the relevant Native American animal lore, simply<br />to acquire a fuller perspective. &#8220;
