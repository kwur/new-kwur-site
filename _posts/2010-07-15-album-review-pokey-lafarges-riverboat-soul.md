Now he is playing international tours across the US and Europe. His newest album <span style="font-style:italic;">Riverboat Soul</span> still features his surprisingly authentic old-time blues and dixieland, but now he has a fantastic backing band, the South City Three, to fill out his sound with upright bass, harmonica, and slide guitar. This album is his first on Free Dirt Records and features some nice guest spots from Ketch Secor of Old Crow Medicine Show on fiddle and Tommy Oliviero of Bawn in the Mash on mandolin. I am pleased to see a St. Louis boy making such great music and having some success at the same time.

    Your next chance to see Pokey in St. Louis is on September 25 in Tower Grove Park or October 8 at Off Broadway.
