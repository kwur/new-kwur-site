    In 1972, Scott Bartlett played with (new) video technology and then filmed it. The resulting piece, OffOn, is a film of psychedelic colorized rephotographed video loops. In 2004, the film was selected for preservation under the Library of Congress National Film Registry.

    “OFFON is so striking a work, so obviously a landmark, that it has been acquired by virtually every major film art collection in America, from the Museum of Modern Art to the Smithsonian Institute.” – Sheldon Renan, Curator, Pacific Film Archive

    Unfortunatley, YouTube’s low-quality compression destroys much of the brilliance of the film. A nice DVD version can be found on <span class="heading">“<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007WFXYO/nationalfilmpr04">Treasures From American Film Archives <i>Encore Edition</i></a></span>“.
