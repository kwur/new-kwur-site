    <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/dirtbombs2-796335.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/dirtbombs2-796320.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>It occurs to me that I like the band The Dirtbombs could be more than I&#8217;ve ever liked the actual band. When The Dirtbombs are at their best, they are a sublime combination of dirty, downright sordid Detroit garage rock grit and a wonderfully grotesque parody of R and B conventions. But that&#8217;s only on a few tracks here; the rest is that bland, vapid shit you forgot about in &#8217;03. DB, you might like this more than me, the rest of you, stick to recommended tracks.
