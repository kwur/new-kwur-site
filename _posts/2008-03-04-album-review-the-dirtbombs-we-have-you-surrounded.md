When The Dirtbombs are at their best, they are a sublime combination of dirty, downright sordid Detroit garage rock grit and a wonderfully grotesque parody of R and B conventions. But that’s only on a few tracks here; the rest is that bland, vapid shit you forgot about in ’03. DB, you might like this more than me, the rest of you, stick to recommended tracks.
