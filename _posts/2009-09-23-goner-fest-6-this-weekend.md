    <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.goner-records.com/gonerfest/IMAGES/GONERFEST-LOGO_72DPI.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 353px; height: 138px;" src="http://www.goner-records.com/gonerfest/IMAGES/GONERFEST-LOGO_72DPI.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Yesterday I suddenly remembered that <a href="http://www.goner-records.com/gonerfest/">Goner Fest 6</a> was going down this weekend in Memphis, Tennessee. One of the good things about being unemployed is that it gives you an extremely open and flexible schedule.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So it looks like I’m going to go on ahead and make the 8 hour drive (from Georgia) to catch the festival which runs from Thursday night through Saturday (or Sunday if you can hang around for some extra wind-down DJ festivities).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Goner Fest is an annual punk and garage rock (garage punk? punk garage?) festival hosted by <a href="http://www.goner-records.com/mainpage.php">Goner Records</a>, the Memphis based label and record store owned by Eric Oblivian (you got it, of the legendary<a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&searchlink=OBLIVIANS&sql=11:jifyxqlhldte%7ET1"> Oblivians</a>).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It’s a pretty great lineup this year, especially for me. Some highlights:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ty Segall</span> (San Francisco, CA)<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reatards</span> (Memphis, TN)<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Intelligence</span> (Seattle, WA)<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Davila 666</span> (San Juan, Puerto Rico)<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sonic Chicken 4</span> (Perpignan, France)<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fresh & Onlys</span> (San Francisco, CA)<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mantles</span> (Oakland, CA)<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Compulsive Gamblers</span> (Memphis, TN)<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yusuf Jerusalem</span> (France)<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gentleman Jesse & His Men</span> (Atlanta, GA)<br />and my personal favorites, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thee Oh Sees</span> (San Francisco, CA)…<br />(full lineup <a href="http://www.goner-records.com/gonerfest/gf6-schedule.php">here</a>)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And speaking of Thee Oh Sees, remember when I <a href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/2009/06/some-2009-favorites-thus-far.html">said</a> we could hope for another LP by the end of the year? Well the wish was granted (and earlier then expected). Their new LP, <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Dog Poison</span>, is out now on Brooklyn based <a href="http://capturedtracks.com/releases.php">Captured Tracks</a>. Do these guys (and girl) ever stick with the same label? Anyway, I know what I’ll be picking up this weekend…<br />[EDIT: <span style="font-style: italic;">Dog Poison</span> is, in fact, a 45 rpm 12″ EP: 10 songs, 23 minutes. Full review coming…]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Suggestions for bands to catch welcomed.<br />But after all, Memphis is only a four hour drive from St. Louis. Something to consider.

    Recap and pictures to come…
