  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">TOM PAXTON</span><br />earnest folk revival folkie (white)<br />penned “bottle of wine” (included in albums of his in station)<br />&#8211;rightly famous, his loosest, catchiest tune to my knowledge<br />as far as subjects go, drinking has a tendency to bring out the best in stiff folkie folks<br />(curious listeners will also seek out the porter wagoner cover on porter&#8217;s “skidrow joe” concept album)<br />not a big tom paxton fan<br />

    <span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />PINE VALLEY COSMONAUTS – EXECUTIONER&#8217;S LAST SONGS, VOL. 1+2</span><br />curated by mr. jon langford of the mekons (those country-lovin&#8217; brits), these compilations were all about ending the death penalty in illinois in the early 2000s blah blah blah and thus feature plenty of Chicago country stars singing songs about death<br />also: these were some of my first favorite country music albums<br />and though they were admittedly a weird entry point into the world I love so passionately these days, they are also v. v. good<br />murder ballads galore! both new and old<br />I cannot recommend these enough (esp. if you are afraid of lovey dovey country schmaltz – none of that here)<br />the back-up band is pretty standard rootsy but the wide variety of songs and singers let them stretch in interesting ways<br />healthy dose of 90&#8217;s cowpunk but also pretty, traditional

    <span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />JIM & JENNIE & THE PINETOPS – ONE MORE IN THE CABIN</span><br />traditionalist bluegrass couple<br />they thankfully seem to lack the kinda common 2nd/3rd wave emphasis on virtuosity and technique<br />though of course these folks are no slouches when it comes to pickin and pluckin<br />requisite high lonesome singing style, but more tuneful in their case than it can sometimes seem<br />unafraid to incorporate specifically none-bluegrass traditional country into their repertoire<br />obv. on account of my bias I tend to prefer these (slower numbers, esp.), but they&#8217;re all good<br />other albums in the stacks of a similar, consistently good quality<br />“the light of day” is beautiful

    <span style="font-weight:bold;">EDDIE PENNINGTON – WALKS THE STRINGS &#8230; AND EVEN SINGS</span><br />legendary picker shows off his skills!<br />mix of acoustic and electric numbers<br />eddie mostly sticks to merle travis-style thumb-picking<br />and some might say he out-travises merle (he may be the master of the style)<br />some cuts exhibit a distinct atkins slicker swingy style and a couple (esp. the bluesier ones he sings) lean toward piedmont blues thumbing<br />don&#8217;t worry if that all means nothing to you<br />he fills his measures to the brim – as thick as any fahey/kottke, any heavy metal shredder<br />but it&#8217;s also all about the fuckin melody!<br />these are virtuosic, show-offy studies that you can hum along to<br />
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />PHRANC</span><br />she is a lesbian folk singer with a crewcut<br />who strums power chord political folk<br />we have lots of her albums<br />I met her when I was a little kid (name drop)<br />the review comments are better-written than her lyrics<br />but you might as well listen to a song or two<br />
  </p>
  
  <p>
    AUSTIN PITRE & HIS EVANGELINE BOYS– OPELOUSAS WALTZ</span><br />this album is wonderful, through and through<br />a live recording of some very distinctly hillbilly zydeco<br />evangeline boys got a real tight rhythm section and goddamnit if those twosteps and waltzes don&#8217;t make you wanna grab your sweetheart and swing<br />steel guitar on some tracks adds to distinct country flava<br />“jolie blonde” (his version of the standard) goes up there with the best versions of all time<br />listen to this album, seriously
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />JOHN PRINE – IN SPITE OF OURSELVES</span><br />john prine writes some of the best songs ever but kwur&#8217;s selection of his records unfortunately does not represent this well<br />this album features only one original song, for instance<br />but it&#8217;s also really good, so that&#8217;s okay<br />a collection of classic country duets, some of the best-ever love and loss songs <br />straight-up close country harmonies featuring iris dement, lucinda williams, patty loveless, et al.<br />listen to “(we&#8217;re not) the jetset” (originally by george and tammy) if you&#8217;ve ever fallen in love on the open road<br />“there&#8217;s no riviera in festus, missouri” &#8212; it&#8217;s true!<br />the one original tune (title track) is classic prine: <br />(iris singin&#8217;:)<br />“he ain&#8217;t got laid in a month of Sundays<br />I caught him once sniffin&#8217; my undies<br />he ain&#8217;t real sharp but he gets things done<br />he drinks his beer like it&#8217;s oxygen<br />he&#8217;s my baby<br />I&#8217;m his honey<br />I&#8217;m never gonna let him go”

    <span style="font-weight:bold;">JIMMIE RODGERS – FIRST SESSIONS</span><br />the father of country music and her first true star<br />aka the blue yodeler (not yet called country songs, he called them blue yodels because he played the blues and then ya know he yodels!)<br />these are from his discovery sessions in 1927 in Bristol, Tennessee (the same sessions that discovered the Carter Family, Country Music&#8217;s 1st Family, naturally)<br />many of his songs were adapted from tin pan alley pop or just written by vaudeville songsmiths<br />and that high drama yodel comes from vaudeville (used in lots of blackface routines, actually)<br />of course jimmie rodgers was an incredible singer, fucking tremendous yodeler<br />and whoever strung these folk strains into pop songs (sometimes it&#8217;s jimmie, sometimes a ghost writer or a credited songwriter) was a pop lyrical genius, a direct predecessor of the chuck berry school of humble, rabid-fire, allusive and specific details<br />he already had tuberculosis when these were recorded so he was a martyr before he died and his pr men totally milked this for implied gravitas btw<br />these songs are all classics so listen to them
