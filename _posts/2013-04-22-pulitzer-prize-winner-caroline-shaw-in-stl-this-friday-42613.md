    It's not every day that a newly minted Pulitzer Prize-winning composer visits St. Louis just after winning said prize.  Yet that is what is happening this week, after <a href="http://www.carolineshaw.com/o/">Caroline Shaw</a> just won the <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2013-Music">2013 Pulitzer Prize in Music</a> for her work "Partita for 8 Voices".  Shaw is appearing this Friday, 4/26/13 at UMSL's Touhill Performing Arts Center with the contemporary music group Alarm Will Sound.  More information about the concert is <a href="http://www.touhill.org/default.asp?touhill=51&objId=1013">here</a>.  If you ever wanted to meet a Pulitzer Prize-winning composer in person, now's your chance.
