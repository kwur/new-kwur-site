    I just discovered this on the Vintage Vinyl website. It&#8217;s a great way to see Jason Isbell without shelling out thirty bucks to see him at the Pageant.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br /><b><br />Jason Isbell</b><br /> <a href="http://www.jasonisbell.com/" target="_blank">http://www.jasonisbell.com</a><br /> November 11 6:00 PM

    Vintage Vinyl is proud to be hosting an instore with former Drive By Trucker Jason Isbell on November 11th. Stopping in to Vintage Vinyl for a special acoustic mini-preview of his full length electric set later that evening, Jason Isbell is out promoting his solo debut &#8220;Sirens Of The Ditch&#8221;. Having turned down the guitar fuzz of his DBT material, he has opted for a more sedate but &#8220;driving&#8221; sound with instruments such as pedal steel and piano that lend a little more soul to his music. and songs. Catch a special acoustic preview at Vintage Vinyl starting at 6:00PM and you&#8217;d be a fool to miss his full length and full blown electric performance later that evening at The Pageant when Jason Isbell opens up for Cracker.
