    Long ago, I was a KWUR DJ. And got to go to CMJ, with a badge and everything. In those days, banks actually had money. This year, I didn&#8217;t have a badge. And look at the banks now&#8230;Being in New York, however, I had the opportunity to go to some of the events. The actual DJs have already covered all the bands that I saw, but I did get a nice little recap from some other attendees. There were lots of complaints about this year&#8217;s festival, but there were a few stand-outs. So, here are some bands that people were talking about at the after party/various other parties:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.myspace.com/wyeoak"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Wye Oak</span></a><br />-Apparently, it&#8217;s mind-blowing that they&#8217;re only two people.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.myspace.com/themaeshi"><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Mae Shi</span></a><br />-Long story short (or short story shorter, rather), <a href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/2008/10/cmj-day-1-descent-into-madness-kenny.html">Kenny&#8217;s right</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://www.myspace.com/passionpitjams">Passion Pit</a></span><br />Lots of people wanted to see them, but no one I talked to actually did. Most people were waiting until Saturday&#8217;s planned rooftop show to see them, but the show got rained out.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.myspace.com/kirstenketsjer"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kirsten Ketsjer</span></a><br />-Okay, no one actually said anything about them. But we saw on Friday night in what was essentially some dude&#8217;s bedroom. By Sunday, their picture was in the <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/26/cmj-no-budgets-plenty-of-diy/">Times</a>. &#8216;Nuff said.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.myspace.com/somanydynamos"><span style="font-weight:bold;">So Many Dynamos</span></a><br />-Granted, this is from people who already knew the Dynamos very well. But, apparently, the new album is awesome. And doesn&#8217;t come out until February. Smarmy bastards.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUQ-RWUvsGE"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Monotonix</span></a><br />-Everybody I spoke to saw them. Suprisingly, everyone came out alive.
