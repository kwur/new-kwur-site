    A couple of weeks ago I had the pleasure of speaking with Phil and Elroy from Cut Off Your Hands about the New Zealand music scene, departed band members, how their sound is progressing, and what it really means to stand around the water cooler at work. They played the Firebird with Viva Voce, and all bands involved put on a killer show. The interview was a lot of fun and you can check it <a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=H5D5EVCN">HERE</a>. ((sorry about the sound quality at the beginning, I was still getting a hang on how to use the Marantz)).
