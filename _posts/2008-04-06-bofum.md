    The KWUR Kickballers beat pseudo-rivals KSLU in kickball today in Tower Grove Park, 10-4. This was a double-or-nothing game, as KWUR won the last match-up. And they/we prevailed again today.

    We played to the sweet sounds of such tracks as &#8220;Raise Up,&#8221; &#8220;Lipgloss,&#8221; and &#8220;Bitch, I&#8217;m Broke.&#8221; (The families with children playing around the game surely appreciated this soundtrack.) Some may say that the secret to KWUR&#8217;s success lay in this music, but I would argue that is, in fact, our incredible athletic ability and enormous hearts that led to the win.
