  <p>
    For fans of the great folk/bluegrass/swing/jazz violinist <a href="http://markoconnor.com/index.php?page=homepage">Mark Oâ€™Connor</a>, I will be conducting a live interview with him this Saturday, 1/17, around 1 PM. Weâ€™ll be talking about his <a href="http://markoconnor.com/index.php?page=cds&display=37">new CD</a> and hopefully lots more. Feel free to listen in on the radio at 90.3 FM, or on the web from the <a href="http://kwur.com/">KWUR website</a>. I might even pass along your questions to him if you want to IM them in ðŸ™‚ .
