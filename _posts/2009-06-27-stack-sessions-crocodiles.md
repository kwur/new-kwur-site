    The <a href="http://www.myspace.com/crocodilescrocodilescrocodiles">Crocodiles</a> show at <a href="http://www.firebirdstl.com/">The Firebird</a> on Wednesday has had a lot of coverage in the last couple of days, mostly because it didn’t happen. You can read more about it on the RFT’s blog A To Z, which posted an initial report <a href="http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/atoz/2009/06/crocodiles_firebird_june_24_2009_wtf.php">here</a> and followed up with Crocodiles’ response <a href="http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/atoz/2009/06/update_crocodiles_responds_firebird_june_24_show_last_night.php">here</a>. Listening to the interview post-show kind of reinforces my understanding that it was a shitty situation, and that neither party is to blame (The Firebird handled the situation phenomenally and it’s certainly not going to stop me from seeing shows there).

    The band says right off the bat that they love playing shows in St. Louis, and they came across as approachable and interesting guys, at least to me. Anyway, if nothing else, it adds another dimension to the scenario (the interview took place 2 hours before the show started).<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=B41CBL0D">Crocodiles interview</a></span>
