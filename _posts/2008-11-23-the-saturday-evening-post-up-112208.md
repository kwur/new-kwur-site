<div class="pf-content">
  <p>
    Thanksgiving is almost upon us, so have a hearty helping of new reviews:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Religious Knives &#8211; &#8220;The Door&#8221;</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/knives_cover_250-784165.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 250px; height: 250px;" src="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/knives_cover_250-784156.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Alternates between organ-accentuated, tom-heavy prog and abrasive, looped psychedelia. Pretty far out shit, definitely on the experimental side &#8211; produced by Thurston Moore, if that&#8217;s any indication. Lots of female vocals that sound just a bit off key. All pretty downbeat. If this all sounds good to you, play it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Play: 1 (bass heavy, brooding prog), 4 (monotonous vocals, organs, plodding drums), 5 (abrasive&#8230; everything. dark), 6 (quickest number here tempo-wise, female + male vocals overlaid, looped abrasiveness)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    RIYD: Goblins, The Doors, no wave
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Thursday/Envy &#8211; &#8220;Split EP&#8221;</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Interesting move for both bands &#8211; Thursday (of emo-core fame) has more experimental, ethereal passages with their tight, clean guitar work, and long-running Japanese hardcore group Envy gives us a brighter, more accessibly-structured sound. PLAY!!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Play: 3 (fast), 5 (accessible screaming), 7 (ballad-like, awesome)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Fox Japan &#8211; &#8220;Hell&#8221;</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The instrumentals aren&#8217;t bad, basic garage rock stuff &#8211; but the vocals are painful. Amateurish, sad, and angry. I don&#8217;t know what else to say &#8211; I can&#8217;t think of anything that sounds like this because I have no idea how this got recorded.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">The Tough Alliance &#8211; &#8220;A New Chance&#8221;</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/thetoughalliance-706533.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/thetoughalliance-706522.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>

  <p>
    Made up of childhood friends Henning Furst and Eric Bergland from Gothenburg, Sweden. Their live shows have been given much media attention in Sweden due to their &#8220;unique&#8221; onstage performances that include bat-swinging. They got thrown off the stage once for doing so. Critics claim that TTA glorify violence in general and hooliganism in particular, something the duo denies.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Play: 7, 1, 3
  </p>
  
  <p>
    RIYD: upbeat Panda Bear, Air France, High Places

  <p>
    And last but not least, a slice of Neutral Milk Hotel interview pie:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sample: So who are some of the other bands that are included in [Elephant Six] besides Olivia Tremor Control?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jeff: There aren&#8217;t really any specific bands. It&#8217;s weird because now that it&#8217;s something people recognize and ask for a definition, I don&#8217;t really have one.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sample: Well, it&#8217;s not as fun when people know what it is. So everyone&#8217;s going to be able to find you in a farmhouse and hound you.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Julian: Scott wanted to set up a tent in Vic Chestnutt&#8217;s house.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Scott: Yeah, I never got around to it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jeff: I don&#8217;t want to leave the house. I just want to stay in. Well, maybe I&#8217;ll walk around the yard. I want to have a dog. A little dog.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Julian: &#8230;and a cat.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sample: You don&#8217;t think you would get bored?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Julian: Who cares? Well, we&#8217;ll record stuff.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jeff: The plan is to be near New York City.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Julian: One of us will always be making a record and everyone else can play on it. And one of us will always be going on tour and so anybody who wants to go can go.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sample: What&#8217;s the worst show on your tour that you&#8217;ve played?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jeff: There was this one member of the band, and he got killed&#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Julian: I would vote for Portland or Jabberjaw [general consent].
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jeff: The Jabberjaw was pretty terrible because our amps are typically pretty quiet and we didn&#8217;t have a PA&#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Julian: No one could hear us.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jeff: And then we played with the Supreme Dicks in Portland and this guy jumped on the stage.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Scott: This wacked-out, new-nazi looking guy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Julian: It was really terrible&#8230; really gross.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Scott: Just to have something to talk about, and it had nothing to do with the Supreme Dicks, but somebody that was there at the show thought they could involve themselves for no apparent reason and tried to shit in a glass.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sample: Did he actually pull down his pants?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Julian: He showed his genitalia&#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jeff: And he was throwing fireworks and stuff.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Scott: But the Supreme Dicks show still rocked. They&#8217;re great.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jeff: We did six or seven shows with them&#8230; it was really a lot of fun.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sample: Are you an honorary member now?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Scott: I&#8217;ve been an honorary member since 1994.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sample: Do you have a card?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Scott: No, but if I go to a show, I can get up and play. That&#8217;s what honorary membership means. I played slide & whistle.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Julian: I played space echo and blew bubbles into the crowd.
