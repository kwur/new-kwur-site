  <p>
    Following the departure of drummer Nick DeWitt, Pretty Girls Make Graves have decided to break up. They will be doing a final, farewell tour this spring (dates will be posted when I get them), but make sure to listen to KWUR and request anything from either The New Romance or Elan Vital â€“ both great albums from this underrated band.
