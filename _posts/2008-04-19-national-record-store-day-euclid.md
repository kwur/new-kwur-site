    National Record Store Day is an amazing creation. I just got back from Euclid Records where St. Louis alt-country legends The Bottle Rockets played an in-store. Lead singer Brian Henneman forgot the second verse to “Thousand Dollar Car,” stopped the song, had an employee look up the lyrics on the store computer, and picked right back up. He later joked that the only thing the internet is good for is paying bills and looking up song lyrics, and thanked us for coming and buying his music in person instead of making a few clicks on iTunes. I love in-stores. <br />So go and support your local independent record store. They’re good people.
