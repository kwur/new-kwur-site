    On April 8, two highly anticipated albums are slated for release. The first, and heretofore most important, is Man Man&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">Rabbit Habits</span>, coming out on Anti-. The second is Tapes &#8216;n&#8217; Tapes <span style="font-style: italic;">Walk it Off</span>, which will be released by XL. Recently, the first tracks from both of these albums have found their way to the internet, primarily through Pitchfork (Stereogum just posted their <a href="http://stereogum.com/archives/premature-evaluation/premature-evaluation-man-man-rabbit-habits_008123.html">review </a>of <span style="font-style: italic;">Rabbit Habits</span>, so more of that may be available shortly). Both of the songs (&#8220;Top Drawer&#8221; and &#8220;Hang Them All,&#8221; respectively) are ridiculously good. With Man Man, this isn&#8217;t such a surprise. We all got to see how good they are last year at KWUR Week, and after two albums, the maturity that Stereogum raves about can be expected, and the result is an eminently accessible track that doesn&#8217;t completely jettison the craziness we all know and love.

    The Tapes &#8216;n&#8217; Tapes track, however, is more of a surprise. After <span style="font-style: italic;">The Loon</span>, they were known more for getting consistently fellated by Pitchfork, without really bringing the goods. They were the example of a Pitchfork hype band. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Loon</span> wasn&#8217;t a bad album, but not nearly as good as Pitchfork insisted. The best thing about them was their appearance in <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3786206610821776395">Clell Tickle</a>. But wouldn&#8217;t you know, &#8220;Hang Them All&#8221; justifies the buzz. It&#8217;s catchy, it&#8217;s got a good beat, and it&#8217;s great.
