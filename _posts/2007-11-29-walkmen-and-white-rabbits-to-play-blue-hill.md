  <p>
    This should be interesting. The Riverfront Times is <a href="http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/atoz/2007/11/built_to_spill_at_the_pageant.php">reporting</a> that the Walkmen will be playing at the Duck Room at Blueberry Hill on January 21. Opening will be the White Rabbits. The White Rabbits’ great new album, Fort Nightly, is, um, influenced by the Walkmen (by influenced, I mean shamelessly rips off, not that that’s necessarily a bad thing). Can the student surpass the teacher? It’s something I definitely want to find out.

    Also, check out Dylan’s review of the first track off Fort Nightly, “Kid On My Shoulders,” just a few posts down.
