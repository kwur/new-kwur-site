    Rafter Roberts writes music for commercials (like Michael Bluth in <span style="font-style: italic;">Juno</span>!*) , and he&#8217;s part of the Sufjan Stevens crew. Therefore, he already had two strikes against him as I started to listen to <span style="font-style: italic;">Sex, Death, Cassette</span>. Fortunately, Rafter was able to come up big with two strikes. <span style="font-style: italic;">Sex, Death, Cassette</span> obliterates any possible genre classification but still manages to sound like a cohesive album, even with upbeat indie songs like &#8220;zzzpenchant,&#8221; an Afrobeat impersonation in &#8220;Love Time Now Please,&#8221; and (shudder) Sufjan Stevens-esque folk making frequent appearances. This is a testament to how well produced this album is, not surprising given that Rafter has produced for artists like the Rapture and Fiery Furnaces. Songs like &#8220;zzzpenchant&#8221; make you want to dance, while on the other end of the spectrum, &#8220;Tropical&#8221; is more heartfelt and somehow absorbing. <span style="font-style: italic;">Sex, Death, Cassette</span> may be coming out in the winter, but it sounds like the perfect soundtrack for a drugged-out summer adventure. Oh, to be out of the cold&#8230;

    * I know his real name is Jason Bateman, and that he&#8217;s been in many other things. I just refuse to accept that <span style="font-style: italic;">Arrested Development</span> isn&#8217;t real
