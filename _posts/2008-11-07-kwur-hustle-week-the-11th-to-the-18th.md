  </p>
  
  <p>
    From November 11<sup>th</sup> to the 18<sup>th</sup>, KWUR is conducting its fundraising drive, Hustle Week. KWUR is run on a shoestring budget that has been dramatically cut twice by Student Union in the past two years, and there is no guarantee that the budget will not be cut again in the future. In the past, fundraising dollars have been spent on essentials like shelves for the 45s and promotional schedule posters. If enough money is raised, it can be used to help pay for an improved KWUR Week, a website redesign, or even music acquisitions. If you care about KWUR and appreciate the quality alternative programming KWUR provides every day and you&#8217;ve got five or ten dollars to spare, we&#8217;d really appreciate any help you can give us.
  </p>
