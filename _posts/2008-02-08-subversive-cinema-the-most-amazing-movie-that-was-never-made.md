      Alejandro Jodorowsky&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">Dune</span></span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Jodorowsky has recently been getting a lot more (deserved) attention thanks to the release of a long-time-coming well produced <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Films-Alejandro-Jodorowsky-Fando-Mountain/dp/B000NY1E9E/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1202508527&sr=8-1">DVD Boxset.</a> For the first time his most well known movies (<span style="font-style: italic;">El Topo</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Holy Mountain</span>) are available (legally) on home video (with included soundtracks!). I, along with a lot of other cinema lovers, can finally watch and re-watch the Jodorowsky weirdness. Additionally, new 35mm prints of these films were made and toured shortly last year.

      So recently, I was completely floored when I heard out about his failed attempt to make <span style="font-style: italic;">Dune</span>. [David Lynch would later make a Hollywood adaptation in 1984 to fund his next film, <span style="font-style: italic;">Blue Velvet</span>]
    </p>

      The <a href="http://www.pimpadelicwonderland.com/lost.html">Wierd World of 70&#8217;s Cinema</a> sums up this lost project best:<br />&#8220;In development from 1974 to 1977, the film was to have featured Orson Welles, David Carradine (hot off the Kung Fu series), Gloria Swanson, Amanda Lear and Salvador Dali as a mad emperor who sits upon a toilet throne. With art design by H.R. Giger and special effects by Dark Star&#8217;s Dan O&#8217;Bannon who both soon after worked together on <span style="font-style: italic;">Alien</span>. Music was to be by Pink Floyd, Tangerine Dream and French prog rockers Magma.&#8221;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      According to Jodorowsky:<br />&#8220;The project was sabotaged in Hollywood. It was French and not American. Their message was &#8216;not Hollywood enough&#8217;. There was intrigue, plunder. The storyboard was circulated among all the big studios. Later, the visual aspect of <span style="font-style: italic;">Star Wars</span> strangely resembled our style. To make <span style="font-style: italic;">Alien</span>, they called Moebius [Giraud], Foss, Giger, O&#8217;Bannon, etc. The project signaled to Americans the possibility of making a big show of science-fiction films, outside of the scientific rigor of <span style="font-style: italic;">2001: A Space Odyssey</span>. The project of Dune changed our lives.&#8221;
