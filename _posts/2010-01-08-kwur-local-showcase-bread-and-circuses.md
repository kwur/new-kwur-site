  <p>
    KWUR does a lot of fun things. We put records on the radio, we laugh, we sometimes cry. Once we gave away Domo dolls. But we also put on shows, like the one we&#8217;re putting on January 22nd at the Gargoyle (Directions <a href="http://studentunion.nts.wustl.edu/~gargoyle/">here</a>. This show will feature all local acts. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/exerciseaudio">Exercise</a>, who were kind enough to do a <a href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/2009/09/stack-sessions-exercise.html">stacks session</a>, will be headlining. Terrific local acts <a href="http://www.myspace.com/dependsonthelivers">The Livers</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/dearvincent">Dear Vincent</a> will also be playing. I say, come out, have fun, it&#8217;ll be a good chance to see what St. Louis has to offer. Also, I keep hearing this crazy rumor that ABBA is going to reunite just to play this show. I honestly don&#8217;t know where that&#8217;s coming from, but I can neither confirm nor deny&#8230;
