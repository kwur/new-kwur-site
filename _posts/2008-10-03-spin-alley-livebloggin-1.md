    8:01: AND SO IT BEGINS! AND I AM LOCATED RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE SPEAKER! AND GWEN IFILL IS BLARING IN MY EAR!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:02: &#8220;Can I call you Joe?&#8221; Eugggh&#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:03, Bailout question, Biden: Man can shape a good word, let&#8217;s see how he does on the reply. Also, he neglects to mentioned that he backed the bankruptcy bill that helped create some of these problems&#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:05, Bailout question, Palin: &#8220;Betcha&#8221;? Maybe it&#8217;s just cuz I&#8217;m an east coast elite, but this have-a-beer-with-me shit grates&#8230;Oh, he&#8217;s a real martyr, suspending the campaign so you can capitalize on it politically.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:07, Bailout question, Biden: &#8220;On the sidelines&#8221;, he takes her words and he twists them without sounding nasty. HATCHAAA!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:09, Bailout, Palin: The change thing just hits me as totally incoherent, still. A change would be a change from you guys, if Biden has bad experience, so does McCain&#8230;Joe Sixpack is gonna solve the bailout by calling his congressman? Doesn&#8217;t fly, sister.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:11, Bailout, Biden: It almost seems like he&#8217;s not even debating her. Might be a good tactic&#8230;as someone who bleeds blue, I love to hear this assault on deregulation&#8230;that anecdote really worked.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:13, Bailout, Palin: Am I not paying attention? What does tax relief have to do with this? Did she just veer off?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:14, Bailout, Biden: Flashback from 04, nice when both candidates are senators, cancels out. AND HE JUST STUCK IT IN!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8:14, Bailout, Palin: I wish I could not turn in a paper and say, &#8220;That&#8217;s what the American people want.&#8221; Fuckin&#8217; weak.
