    Hello readers. T.G. Foist here.

    We're making an effort to ressurect the blog &#8211; start checking back here for KWUR news (there will be plenty of it this semester) and random musings. This is something of a random musing, but first some quick KWUR newses:

    Now on to the post. This is precipitated by today's <a href="http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/news/latest-news/my-bloody-valentine-play-new-material-album-due-this-week-116887" target="_blank">news</a> that the new My Bloody Valentine album is set to drop some time in the next few days. It's about time. I'm going to pretend that this latest bit of news is totally reliable, and ask: What are we supposed to listen to for the next 2-3 days until the album comes out (besides the KWUR stream)?

    I think the answer is a KWUR-prescribed helping of shoegaze, while avoiding MBV at all costs. First, this regimen could help ease the massive level of disappointment that you might experience upon hearing the new album, which is probably the most anticipated album in the entire age of indie music. If it stinks, you can just put the old MBV stuff back on, and even have some new shoegaze artists for your consolation. Furthermore, checking out some of KWUR's favorite shoegaze might help expand your tastes beyond the narrow range of big-name shoegaze bands, who have a near-oligopolistic standing in the genre. Finally, there is something about shoegaze that makes it fit in very well with the St. Louis spring, where you have those random bursts of 70-80 degree days. The basic features of shoegaze music (loudness, melodicism) complement the ecstatic sensory overload that I tend to associate with this type of weather.

    Here are some of my favorites. I believe we have original physical copies of all of these albums in the station, too. Cool! Please comment with your own links and suggestions.

    <strong>The Boo Radleys</strong>
  </p>

    The atmosphere of their music is a little lighter and airier than most shoegaze tends to be, but when they go into blister mode, they blister with the best.

    <strong>All Natural Lemon & Lime Flavors</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &nbsp;

  <p>
    One of the only shoegaze bands I've heard that can jangle, rock, bleep, bloop, and screech all in one song.

    <strong>Sweet Trip</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>

  <p>
    One album wonder (2003's Velocity:Design:Comfort), but the album is an amazing combination of modern electronics and shoegaze.

    Basically everything they do is completely percussionless, slow, dense, and reverby.

    Questionable combination of shoegaze and alt rock machismo. But often enough, they get it just right (hear: chorus of Duel).
