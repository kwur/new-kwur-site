  <p>
    So it’s now come to this: as of July 7, 2010, thanks to actions by the leaders of the Lutheran Church-MO Synod and Joy-FM best summarized by the ghost of Hamlet’s father in line 27 of <a href="http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/hamlet/H15.html">Act I, Scene 5</a> of Shakespeare’s play, one station remains in St. Louis that broadcasts a locally hosted classical music show to any extent. For as long as I can, to recycle the cliche from <a href="http://blog.kwur.com/2010/06/recent-classical-new-releases-at-kwur.html">my earlier KWUR blog post</a>, I’ll try to keep the flame going in St. Louis, with help from fellow KWUR DJ’s as needed.
