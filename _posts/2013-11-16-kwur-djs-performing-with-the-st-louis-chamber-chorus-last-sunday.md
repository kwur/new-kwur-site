    Besides having shows at KWUR, it's not always known that several KWUR DJ's each year participate in the larger musical life of the Wash. U. and St. Louis community, through performing with various groups.&nbsp; This past Sunday was one of those cases, with the concert by the <a href="http://www.chamberchorus.org/">St. Louis Chamber Chorus</a> at United Hebrew Congregation in Creve Coeur, West County.&nbsp; The Washington University Concert Choir and their director, Nicole Aldrich, were guest artists with the Chamber Chorus.&nbsp; The WUCC sang one selection on its own, and joined the Chamber Chorus for 4 works.&nbsp; The KWUR folks involved in this concert were Aine O'Connor, Charles Herrera, and past KWUR DJ Alex Luke in the choir, and guest violinist Jonathan Karp.&nbsp; The review of the concert from the St. Louis Post Dispatch is <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/arts-and-theatre/reviews/music-review-st-louis-chamber-chorus-sings-hebrew-works-from/article_1a8ffb80-cf8b-508b-957c-a4e8aac22b38.html">here</a>.&nbsp; Well done to all.
