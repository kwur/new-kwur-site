RIYL: Sufjan Stevens, or a folky Cat Power. She mixes in some Rilo Kiley-type pop hooks here, not sure if it’s effective. Positively warm, intimate, vulnerable, sexy even.

    Play: 1++(short, but she should have an entire album like this), 2++(The single, fun!), 3+ (boner jam, or, er, sexy), 5, 8
