    St. Louis often gets the short end of the stick as far as great metal shows are concerned. While we live in a respectably-sized city, we are in relative geographic isolation compared to some of our larger-market midwestern brethren: namely Chicago and Cleveland. In my opinion we get two or three or four really good shows per year, and as such we must make a concerted effort to support them when they do come to town. This is one of those moments. The "Frak the Gods Tour" (kudos to the promoter for the Battlestar Galactica reference) features a truly incredible lineup of some of the best up-and-comers the scene has to offer. Headliner Periphery has been making waves since their self-titled Djent-styled debut album came out last year, and better support cannot be found than Dutch metallers Textures and their American Tech-Death comrades The Human Abstract, both of which released monster albums this year (the latter's "Digital Veil" being one of my favorite records thus far in 2011). The show is tomorrow evening (Sept. 27) at Fubar in central west end. Now that you have been briefed on the significance of this event, you have no excuse not to be in attendance. I shall link to music videos from all three bands, for your visual and auditory pleasure.
