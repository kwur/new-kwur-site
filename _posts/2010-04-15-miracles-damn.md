    <b>DAMU THE FUDGEMUNK &#8211; HOW IT SHOULD SOUND VOL. 1 & 2</b>

    This is a collection of previously unreleased instrumental beats from Washington D.C. producer Damu the Fudgemunk.

  <p>
    In my opinion, this is the best hip-hop producer to emerge in the last couple of years. (I say that in terms of straight-up hip-hop beats, as opposed to more hybridized hip-hop forms, like you see in guys like Flying Lotus.) This man continues the finest traditions of crate digging, layering dope soul/funk/jazz samples with all the technical skill of Pete Rock or Premier. His beats are absolutely good enough to be listened to as instrumentals, the sign of any truly dope producer, and are intricate enough to keep you listening and not come off as repetitive. In addition to all the <i>really</i> dusty samples, he has the unique talent of taking recognizable samples used by his 90s predecessors and flipping them in totally new ways. So you get that &#8220;oh shit, I know that!&#8221; factor but it&#8217;s still very fresh at the same time. For some reason, Damu hasn&#8217;t absolutely exploded in the underground. (I asked Sadat X if he knew this guy, and we was like &#8220;Damon Fudge-who?&#8221; and I was like that&#8217;s really depressing.) Changing his lame-ass name would certainly be a good start towards fame.
