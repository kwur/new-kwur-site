    Meet <a href="http://www.anamanaguchi.com/">Anamanaguchi</a>. Here&#8217;s how they describe themselves: &#8220;Anamanaguchi makes loud, fast music with a hacked NES from 1985.&#8221; Here&#8217;s what <a href="http://www.ohmyrockness.com/BandBio.cfm?BandID=20203">Oh My Rockness</a> has to say: &#8220;Guitarist/Programmer Peter Berkman hacks into an original Nintendo and manipulates its sound chip to create, along with Ary Warnaar and James DeVito, some of the catchiest and most delightful rock-outs you&#8217;ll hear.&#8221; My goal for the summer now is to see them live, but you can listen for yourself <a href="http://www.8bitpeoples.com/discography/by/anamanaguchi">here</a>. Or better yet, <a href="http://www.dawnmetropolis.com/">watch</a>.<br /><a href="http://www.8bitpeoples.com/files/8bp065-01-anamanaguchi-sting_operation.mp3"><br />Anamanaguchi &#8211; Sting Operation</a> (MP3 via 8bitpeoples)
