    Yesterday evening, Congress finally passed the <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-s592/text">Local Community Radio Act</a>, as <a href="http://www.freepress.net/press-release/2010/12/18/free-press-cheers-passage-local-community-radio-act">Freepress</a> reports.&nbsp; Essentially, the bill opens up the broadcast spectrum to community-oriented low power FM stations, as a public resource and an opportunity for millions of people to have their voices heard.&nbsp; This is huge step forward in seizing the airwaves from corporate interests and giving them to the average citizen, and for that alone, I am grateful.&nbsp; However, it also offers our humble station the opportunity to upgrade our wattage to a respectable output.&nbsp; We started out with a 10-watt signal in 1976, and that's where we've been since then.&nbsp; That's not to say we haven't tried to increase our wattage (<a href="http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2002-08-07/music/the-old-college-try/">this</a> is a nice crash-course on past attempts) &#8211; but, for the first time in 34 years, because of this bill's passage, we have a legitimate chance at upgrading to 100 (or God forbid, 250) watts. &nbsp;

    We're not quite sure yet how the bill is going to affect the St. Louis radio market or KWUR, but ideally, it will open up a few frequencies on the band, which would be filled by low power FM stations (like ours). The LCRA does this by eliminating the "third-adjacent minimum separation" requirement for broadcast signals, such that frequencies will become available now where they were prohibited by the buffer before.

    I don't want to overstate our chances here; I really have no idea if and how it will affect our wattage situation (but believe me, we're going to find out).&nbsp; I do know, though, that this was our only reasonable chance at getting an upgrade, and now that we have it, we're going to do everything we can to pursue it.&nbsp; The next few months (or possibly years) will be tumultuous and we've got our work cut out for us, but I can honestly say that I have never been more excited to be involved with a college/community radio station.&nbsp; Stay tuned to the blog (and of course, over the air) for more information as it comes to us.&nbsp; Viva radio free St. Louis!
