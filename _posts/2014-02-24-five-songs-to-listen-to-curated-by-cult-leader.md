    <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;">Gaza was once a band. Now, they're a better band, and are called Cult Leader. Gaza was one of the first heavy concerts I ever attended&nbsp;back when I was in my early teens, and I've always loved their music. It's safe to say they rank among the best bands that Salt Lake City has ever produced.&nbsp;I was fortunate enough to get drummer Casey Hansen to send us a list of five songs to listen to, so read on:</span></span>

The Electrician &#8211; Scott Walker The hardest thing to do in music is to marry true dissonance, discord, weirdness, and darkness with beauty and do it in a way that doesn't sound mashed together and underdeveloped. This song finds a way to flawlessly bridge musical chasms like nothing I've heard before.</span></span></span>

Night Terrors &#8211; Cursed There's a reason everyone rips this band off and nobody wants to admit it.</span></span></span>

Reckless Burning &#8211; Jesse Sykes and Sweet Hereafter Just an amazing song. There's nothing I can say about this song to add or detract from it. </span></span></span>

They Sent You &#8211; Mare This band put out one EP ever, and it's amazing. Because of that, the potency of their catalog is perhaps stronger than anyone's. I've still never really heard a band to fairly compare this to. Pure genius.</span></span></span>

Concubine &#8211; Converge Mind-bending, game-changing, and life-changing. For me anyway, that's pretty much all there is to say.</span></span></span>
