  <p>
    9:01, Biden, Afghanistan: Man, this debate is stalling, which means that Palin wins by default.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9:01, Biden, Intervention: Ifill is asking some nice questions. I&#8217;m so glad she&#8217;s moderating this debate&#8230;It&#8217;s Palin&#8217;s response to Bosnia I&#8217;m interested in&#8230;Biden&#8217;s excuse for voting for the war is lame, the same way it was when Clinton said it&#8230;Darfur! The kids like that.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9:03, Palin, Intervention: Aw shucks, y&#8217;all, I&#8217;m not a Washington insider, I don&#8217;t know nothing bout no ko-so-vo. C&#8217;mon, America, you have to be horrified by this, it&#8217;s Bush&#8217;s populist conservative &#8220;jus&#8217; folks&#8221; bullshit taken to a grotesque extreme. Does it seem as staged to you as it does to me? Does it sound as dumb to you as it does to me?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9:05, Biden, Intervention/Iraq: Does Biden look too much like a grumpy-puss?&#8230;It&#8217;s much harder for him to make &#8220;McCain&#8217;s got bad judgment&#8221; points than Barack Obama, since he&#8217;s tainted.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9:06, Palin, Iraq: She gets really thrown off when Biden gets tough on foreign policy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9:07, Biden, Succession: &#8220;The worst outcome imaginable. But if it did&#8230;&#8221; lolz&#8230;.Capture and kill! BLOODLUST, YEAH!&#8230;he really gets on a roll
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9:09, Palin, Succession: &#8220;What do you expect!&#8221; this perkiness is surreal, &#8220;Maverick!&#8221; is not the answer they want here, you must be reading from the wrong sheet&#8230;I really hope this conservative ideology, with the fucking economy melting down, doesn&#8217;t hold water. Government, please help, no?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9:10, Biden, Succession: He doesn&#8217;t seem silly when he does the populist line, although there&#8217;s a little bit of &#8220;my father was a balllicker there&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9:11, Palin, Succession: Wow! &#8220;Say it ain&#8217;t so, Joe!&#8221; Shout-out?!? This woman is unhinged. Also, gaffe? Joe&#8217;s wife already has a reward in heaven.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9:13, Ifill: &#8220;Everybody gets extra credit tonight.&#8221; Marry me.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9:13, Palin, warm bucket of piss: Cute exchange&#8230;what in God&#8217;s name is she talking about with VP exerting more power in the Senate &#8220;if she so chose&#8221;? Has she been talking to Cheney?&#8230;Did I mention my baby has Down Syndrome? I think she&#8217;s really falling apart here.
