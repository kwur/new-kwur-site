Reminds me of a St. Louis version of Bishop Allen. A ridiculously catchy EP released in anticipation of the full length, <span style="font-style: italic;">Alphabet Graveyard</span>, this includes 2 songs from the album (I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s &#8220;ABCDEFGraveyard&#8221; and &#8220;The Book of Matches&#8221;, but I really don&#8217;t know), a b-side, and 2 unreleased tracks. It&#8217;s pretty much impossible to get &#8220;The Book of Matches&#8221; out of your head, which overshadows the greatness of &#8220;ABCDEFGraveyard&#8221; right before it, and the appropriately titled closer, &#8220;A Parting Shot&#8221;, is beautiful and leaves a lasting impression.<br />Check Gentleman Auction House out now. It wont be much longer until everyone else has.
