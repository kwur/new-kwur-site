    Hey!
  </p>

    Have you guys heard about my new favorite thing that happened this summer? It's called Death Grips and its my new favorite thing. Here's why:

    So as a person who mainly listens to hip-hop but recently has for some reason gotten into hardcore punk [Black Flag] and heavy electronic noises [Tobacco], I have been thinking all the time: 'I wish there was a really intense hip-hop group that utilized heavy electronic noises and yelled ALL OF THEIR LYRICS.' Then this happened. Death Grips is a trio made up of drummer Zack Hill (having cut his teeth in the group Hella), some mysterious angry guy named MC Ride and a third even more mysterious guy (Flatlander?) who maybe has a hand in producing. What do they do? Well sometimes they take a famous Link Wray song and chop it up and make it ear-bleedingly awesome and then yell over it (<a href="http://youtu.be/Vd1-P-R_f-0">"Spread Eagle Cross the Block"</a>). Sometimes they make sparse, heavy beats and then yell over that (<a href="http://youtu.be/89F5fpvwPr0">"Takyon"</a>). Sometimes they take Black Flag samples and yell over those (<a href="http://youtu.be/DaE8cMt_8iU">"Klink"</a>). Sometimes they make far too intense electronic beats and yell over that, but for you guys that like yelling less, there are a couple super cool electronic tracks with regular talking (<a href="http://youtu.be/WnsI67bHpmk">"Culture Shock"</a>). I think it's super cool future music and I think it's awesome.
