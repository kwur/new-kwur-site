Additionally, many of these tracks have been in their live repertoire for a while now. This album is somewhat less bombastic and more contemplative than “Six Demon Bag”, but that’s a good thing. The longer production time (and better production overall) has allowed Man Man to create a delirious, virtuosic phantasmagoria tempered with a deeply moving, tragic romanticism. In short, nothing less than a modern opus.
