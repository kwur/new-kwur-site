    In light of this, let&#8217;s take a look back into music festival history. Waaaay back in 1996, Clinton was starting his second term, the economy was looking up with the development of this new-fangled interweb, and Lollapalooza announced that Metallica was going to headline the &#8217;96 tour. The cries of pained and outraged indie fans (I&#8217;m not sure if the word &#8220;indie&#8221; had been coined yet, but you know what I mean) echoed far and wide, and it would be the last actual Lollapalooza tour. Keep in mind, these are the people who had sponsered Rage Against the Machine, Sonic Youth, The Beastie Boys and so many others in recent past. The tour tanked, attendence sucked, and Lollapalooza wouldn&#8217;t appear again for another 7 years. In other words, Metallica effectively killed Lollapalooza in its original inception.

    Flash forward 12 odd years; a Clinton might once again take office, the economy is in the shitter, and Bonnaroo announces that Metallica (not to mention Jack Johnson) is headlining in 2008. Again, keep in mind, Radiohead headlined in 2006. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I have no real issue with Metallica, but this isn&#8217;t 1998. Or 1988, for that matter. Festivals with the potential to attract so many people should be showcasing new bands as well, and yet I don&#8217;t see a single band that hasn&#8217;t been around for at least a couple of years (yes, even Vampire Weekend has been together since last year). This probably won&#8217;t spell an end to Bonnaroo, but really, they can do better. I&#8217;ll be damned if I&#8217;ll pay $250 bucks a ticket to see Metallica and Jack Johnson.

    Here&#8217;s to hoping for a better Lolla lineup.
