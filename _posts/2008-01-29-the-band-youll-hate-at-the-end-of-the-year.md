    Vampire Weekend.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Their album was officially released today (basically, its the same as what was going around last summer, just with strings added and 2 new songs), and really, every song is great. You can read all sorts of bullshit about the atmosphere and the preppiness-hipster battle thats deep within the album on pretty much all of the big music blogs today, but there isn’t really a clunker to be found on the album (M79 comes the closest). Here’s the thing though, they’re a bunch of preppy, Ivy League dudes, and the album isn’t that far separated from OAR-esque jam band douchiness (separated just enough to be great). Vampire Weekend is going to be everywhere. It’s only a matter of time before the backlash comes, and in a big way too. Enjoy the album while you can, there’s a lot to enjoy.
