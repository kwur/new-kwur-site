    The Coen brothers are teaming up again with <span style="font-style: italic;">No Country for Old Men</span> (one of the best movies of 2007) producer Scott Rudin to <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117980719.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&nid=2563">adapt</a> Michael Chabon&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">The Yiddish Policeman&#8217;s Union</span> (one of the best books of 2007) for the big screen. The over/under on Oscar nominations for when this movie gets made is 4.5.

    I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see George Clooney end up in this also.
