    Really great early-90s style lo-fi, with lots of psychelic 60s pop influence on some tracks<br />CZECH OUT:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1– Mostly just an intro segue into 2, very short. <br />2–good spaced-out feel, i like the layered guitar parts<br />4–******PLAY PLAY PLAY******** bells, guitars, fantastic vocal melody, very 60s, play play play!<br />5–beautiful instrumental, “Sag Harbor Bridge,” arpeggiated guitar, very evocative<br />6–great pop song, very Zombies/Kinks/60s melody and chord progression, i like it a lot. pretty short though.<br />7–The start of the noisy part of the album. almost post-hardcore. tense guitar, punky bass.<br />8– mellow pop interlude, nothing special<br />9– dissonant guitars and chanting, ebbs and flows, builds and releases<br />10– very noisy jam.

    Play it, please. It is wonderful, it has so many different styles while remaining coherent and recognizable as one piece. CZECH IT OUT!
