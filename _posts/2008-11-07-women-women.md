    1&#8211; Mostly just an intro segue into 2, very short. <br />2&#8211;good spaced-out feel, i like the layered guitar parts<br />4&#8211;******PLAY PLAY PLAY******** bells, guitars, fantastic vocal melody, very 60s, play play play!<br />5&#8211;beautiful instrumental, &#8220;Sag Harbor Bridge,&#8221; arpeggiated guitar, very evocative<br />6&#8211;great pop song, very Zombies/Kinks/60s melody and chord progression, i like it a lot. pretty short though.<br />7&#8211;The start of the noisy part of the album. almost post-hardcore. tense guitar, punky bass.<br />8&#8211; mellow pop interlude, nothing special<br />9&#8211; dissonant guitars and chanting, ebbs and flows, builds and releases<br />10&#8211; very noisy jam.
