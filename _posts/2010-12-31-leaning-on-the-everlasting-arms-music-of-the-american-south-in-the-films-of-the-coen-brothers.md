    Like many Jews, my Christmas season was filled with movies and Chinese food. I made two trips to my favorite Taiwanese restaurant and got to the theater to see the Coen brothers' adaptation of Charles Portis' novel <i>True Grit</i>. For me, the film was most distinguished by its dialogue, much of which <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/12/21/the-author-behind-true-grit/">can apparently be attributed to the Portis novel</a>. But, this is the KWUR blog, so I'll discuss another aspect I really enjoyed: the film's music.

    The Coens teamed up with frequent collaborator Carter Burwell, who provided the score, which was inspired heavily by 19<sup>th</sup> century hymns. In particular, Burwell draws largely upon the 1887 hymn, &ldquo;Leaning on the Everlasting Arms,&rdquo; written by Elisha Hoffman with music by Anthony Showalter, which was <a href="http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/l/o/lotearms.htm">inspired by the deaths of two of</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/l/o/lotearms.htm">Showalter's friends' wives</a>. Many <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO8uyHtOAHo">20<sup>th</sup> century versions</a> of "Leaning" tend to be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LNJeSuvzv8&feature=related">joyous and fairly upbeat</a> and deliver&nbsp;the final verse about being free&nbsp;from dread and fear with a sense of levity shared by many Americans who faithfully flock to their megachurches every Sunday for entertainment and little more.&nbsp; Burwell, on the other hand, remains faithful to the original spirit of Hoffman and Showalter's hymn in the score, acknowledging the darkness without drifting into its depths.&nbsp; This score complements well the quest of the film's fourteen year-old protagonist, Mattie Ross, to avenge her father's murder, a grisly task which she pursues with due righteousness.&nbsp;

    At the end of the film, as the final shot lingers on the screen before the credits roll, the Coen brothers play <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2BAqUuIQqo">Iris DeMent's version</a> of "Leaning," off her 2004 album, <em>Lifeline</em>.&nbsp; Though the actual ending disappointed me to a certain degree, I think their use of DeMent's version was nonetheless incredibly poignant and avoids the pitfall of many contemporary versions.
