    The American minimalist composer Steve Reich is 70 this month, and celebrations of his music are going on in the US and Europe. One of them is on Wednesday 10/25 at the UMSL Touhill Performing Arts Center (TouPAC). The London vocal group Synergy is featured, along with SLSO musicians. There is a 50% off coupon for &#8220;Zone 1&#8221; tickets at this link:

    With the new Cross-County MetroLink extension, it&#8217;s easy to get to the TouPAC by taking MetroLink to UMSL North. The concert starts at 7:30 PM and goes to about 8:45 PM. (No word on whether Reich himself will be present.)

    Also, for those who can&#8217;t get enough of hearing David Robertson, the Symphony&#8217;s music director, talk, he&#8217;s going to be at the Regional Arts Commission, 6128 Delmar, across from The Pageant, on Thursday 10/19, from 5:30 PM-7:30 PM, talking on whatever comes to mind. An announcement is at the Symphony&#8217;s news page, the 10/9/06 link to the pdf:
