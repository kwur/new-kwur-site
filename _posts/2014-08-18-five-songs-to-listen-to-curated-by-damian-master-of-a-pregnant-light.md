    Damian Master is the mastermind behind the incredible hybrid post-punk/black metal outfit A Pregnant Light, as well as the leading man behind the equally fantastic <a href="http://www.colloquialsoundrecordings.bigcartel.com/">Colloquial Sound Recordings</a>. I was very fortunate to be able to obtain a list of five songs to listen to from him, covering everything from Bathory to Evian Christ. Check them out below!

    1. Future &#8211; "Sh!t"&nbsp;

    This song more than anything in the past couple months gets me going. &nbsp;Future's delivery is absolutely furious. &nbsp;I can hear the anger and rage. &nbsp;One thing I've always loved about hip hop is that when they beef with someone, they call them out. &nbsp;They name names. &nbsp;They're shooters. &nbsp;They'll take you out. &nbsp;The real ones will, and that's the only type of thing I'm interested in. &nbsp;Seems like in the metal/punk world the worse thing you can get is snide subtweet. &nbsp;If any one wants to say something nasty to me, direct it at me, and expect a response. I'm not a coward. &nbsp; Lots of people pretend like the things they say online or in social media aren't important, or- they choose to believe when they are important. &nbsp;You word is your word, no matter where it is. &nbsp;Talk shit, get hit. &nbsp;That's the rule.

    2. Secret Creation &#8211; "My Candle Fears It Won't Be Burned"&nbsp;

  <div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">
    This song is everything I look for in a furious black metal song. &nbsp;True black metal is Bathory, Celtic Frost, Nifelheim, Venom, Amebix (truly primitive!!) Dissection, Necrovore, Bathory, pre-De Mysteriis Mayhem (DEATHCRUSH!!!), Bathory, etc. &nbsp;Atmosphere has it's place, but overall, pure black metal must have riffs. &nbsp;It can't all be atmosphere. &nbsp;When I look at 90% of black metal bands today, they're all these washing atmospheres and nothing to stand up tall about. &nbsp;This is heavy metal, not some forrest-dwelling nerd realm. &nbsp;Ok, maybe it is the latter, but not in my world. &nbsp;Not on my watch. &nbsp;

  <div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">
    3. Bathory &#8211; "The Wind of Mayhem"&nbsp;
  </div>

  <div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">
    Ok, all this talk of Bathory makes me want to listen to Bathory. &nbsp;I know Mayhem took their name from the Venom song, but I often wonder if this track wasn't also an inspiration, if not an affirmation. &nbsp;This was released in '85, and Mayhem had formed the previous year but didn't release the "Pure Fucking Armageddon" until '86. &nbsp;People forget that riffs are what truly makes something stand out. &nbsp;I don't forget. &nbsp;This track is everything that people try to pull off, but can't. &nbsp;There are riffs and atmosphere. &nbsp;It's perfect. &nbsp;

    4. Eisley &#8211; "Ambulance"&nbsp;

    Last winter I was&nbsp;incapacitated due to a 13-hour spinal reconstructive surgery. &nbsp;Having been raised in the midwest of America, I have always equated freedom with the ability to get in&nbsp;your vehicle and drive. &nbsp;Against doctor's orders and amidst the worst winter on record in 30 years, I got slowly into my pickup truck and drove. &nbsp;It was my only exercise in freedom. &nbsp;I could't walk without a walker, I couldn't bend and it took me two minutes to get in and out of my truck. &nbsp;I listened to a lot of Eisley while driving. &nbsp;Like, on repeat. &nbsp;The Valley is a perfect record. I have their latest one, but I need to spend more time with it. &nbsp;Eisley calmed my soul in a way that is hard to describe. &nbsp;These songs aren't saccharine and feel-good. &nbsp;They're songs of hope and despair simultaneously. &nbsp;Gorgeous voices.&nbsp;

    I work at a record store, and saw the LP. &nbsp;I was totally going to buy it, but I didn't want to spend $17 on four songs, so I decided to pick it up on iTunes, since I figured rather than spinning the vinyl, it would be something I would listen to in my truck anyway. &nbsp;I haven't spent much time with it, but I really like what I've heard of it. &nbsp;I have like, wayyyy too many records. &nbsp;I love punk rock 7"s and I love the 12" format as well, and since I buy so many records, I've been picking up a lot of dance/electronic stuff digitally. &nbsp;Always buying, never illegally downloading. &nbsp;Having the wax is cool, but ultimately this is headphone music while I ride my bike or zone out while driving. &nbsp;Plus, $4.00 on iTunes or Boomkat allows me to buy more music than if I was just physical only. Buy music, scumbags. &nbsp;(by the way, I get records at cost at my record store, so I'm not really "supporting" my record store by buying it, in fact it's probably a small loss since we are getting paid for the time ordering stock and putting it out, plus &#8211; leave it to sell to someone! Plus, I buy so many records, dude. So many.)
