    Between the Buried and Me is one of the best metal bands of the last decade, infusing metalcore roots with a healthy dose of melodicism, as well as elements of blues and jazz, arena rock, bluegrass, and just about anything else you can think of, creating their self-described "adult contemporary progressive death metal" sound.

    Their 2007 album "Colors" is widely considered a progressive metal masterpiece.&nbsp; They recenlty released the EP "The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues" on Victory Records.

    Animals as Leaders is led by 8-string guitar wizard Tosin Abasi, and his jazz-and-electronica influenced "djent" stylings.

    Thier second album, "Weightless" was just released on Prosthetic Records, and is one of the&nbsp; best records of 2011, in my opinion.

    Both bands will be performing at The Pageant on Sunday, November 13. Doors open at 7 pm.
