  <p>
    They (Andy Warhol) say that in the future, everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes. Maybe instead, they should have said &#8220;on the internet,&#8221; and instead of &#8220;will be famous&#8221; they should have said &#8220;will be mentioned on the blog of a popular webcomic.&#8221;<br />Our very own <a href="http://newsworthyghost.wordpress.com/">Newsworthy Ghost Island</a> has experienced just such an event&#8211; one of their sketches was mentioned on the <a href="http://areyouexpendable.com/a/?p=21">blog</a> of <a href="http://wondermark.com/">Wondermark</a>, a pretty well-regarded web comic. You can hear the sketch, &#8220;Minion,&#8221; at <a href="http://newsworthyghost.wordpress.com/sketches/">their archive of sketches</a>. The sketch consists of a series of interviews with the henchmen (minions) of a mad scientist/supervillian.
