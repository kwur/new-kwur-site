  <p>
    They (Andy Warhol) say that in the future, everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes. Maybe instead, they should have said “on the internet,” and instead of “will be famous” they should have said “will be mentioned on the blog of a popular webcomic.”<br />Our very own <a href="http://newsworthyghost.wordpress.com/">Newsworthy Ghost Island</a> has experienced just such an event– one of their sketches was mentioned on the <a href="http://areyouexpendable.com/a/?p=21">blog</a> of <a href="http://wondermark.com/">Wondermark</a>, a pretty well-regarded web comic. You can hear the sketch, “Minion,” at <a href="http://newsworthyghost.wordpress.com/sketches/">their archive of sketches</a>. The sketch consists of a series of interviews with the henchmen (minions) of a mad scientist/supervillian.
