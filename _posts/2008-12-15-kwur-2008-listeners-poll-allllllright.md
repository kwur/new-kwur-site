    Hey folks,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I promised a little poll thing last week, but life got in the way and I didn&#8217;t get around to making it until this weekend. Thus, without further ado&#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=1Ggrs8QI65eVnqdLk3ea9g_3d_3d">CLICK HURRRR</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/monkeymusic.logo.large-774255.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 266px; height: 320px;" src="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/monkeymusic.logo.large-774253.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
  </p>

    Okay, a few things. First up, yeah, it looks like the Pitchfork poll but that&#8217;s because the survey generator they used is super easy to work with. All of the music listed in the best album/etc. was played on KWUR this past year (with a single exception, which should be pretty easy to pick out). So, yeah, the list may not be comprehensive, but it&#8217;s what we&#8217;re playing. It&#8217;s a great opportunity to see what you like/hate, and also what we&#8217;re missing or you&#8217;d like to see us play more of.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Most importantly, if you take the survey and give us your email at the end, you will be entered to win an Of Montreal schwag-pack &#8211; including the new album, Skeletal Lamping, on vinyl, CD, a poster, and pins. Take the survey before someone steals it! (oh yeah, we&#8217;re not gonna do anything with the email addresses after that, just need a way to tell you that you&#8217;ve won)
