    First up, schedule changes. Exercise was not able to make it into the studio today due to work scheduling conflicts, so we’re in the process of figuring out when they’ll be able to drop by next – hopefully soon. Our apologies if you tuned in! HOWEVER, my favorite Cincinnati band, <a href="http://www.badveins.net/">Bad Veins</a>, have agreed to stop by and play an acoustic set right after Dead Confederate on Wednesday. Both bands will be playing the Firebird that night, so you should listen and then go, as it will undoubtedly be an excellent show. Check out an earlier interview with Bad Veins <a href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/2009/06/looking-back-eulogies-bad-veins.html">here</a> – if that’s any indication, the in-studio should be a lot of fun.

    KWUR Audio Service extraordinaire Tara and I trooped over to the Luminary Center for the Arts to catch DC/Louisville quintet <a href="http://www.theseunitedstates.net/">These United States</a> on Saturday. We hung out with the guys pre-show and had a nice conversation, which included talk of their new album (titled “Everything Touches Everything”), their thoughts on these United States (the country, not themselves) and pool parties with 13-year-olds (as featured in a music video from said forthcoming album). Also, Jesse became very upset and yelled at me when I did not know what “crazy bread” was. Sorry dude.
