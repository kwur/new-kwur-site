  <p>
    This guy (an alter-ego of former Swollen Members MC Moka Only) is apparently MF Doom’s non-union Canadian equvialent. I say that with all due respect; he shares Viktor Vaughn’s mumbly yet smooth flow and acrobatic wordplay. The beats here are great too, Factor provides a slightly jazzy De La Soul like old school sound. Plus, Ron Contour raps a lot about food. I love food! Play all!

    Play: 1+++, 3++, 5++, 6+++ and 8++ (love the beats here), 10+ (goes to Japan), 12++ (great guest verse)
