  <p>
    With the pending (and thoroughly unwarranted and corrupt) demise of KFUO, 99.1 FM next month, that will leave one station left in St. Louis that will have any locally hosted classical music radio programming (both terrestial radio and internet[#]), namely this one. Classical music radio from KWUR has been a somewhat under-the-radar situation for quite a while, but with this turn of events, it is perhaps time to emerge a little bit more from under the radar. If anyone wishes to listen in, the classical show is normally on Saturdays from 11 AM to 2 PM, hosted by myself, barring pre-emption by sports or other circumstances. This is no substitute for 99.1 FM, of course, and I certainly can never fully fill the shoes of 99.1 FM. But I would like people to know that one local low-power student station is keeping the flame of locally based classical radio alive in St. Louis.
