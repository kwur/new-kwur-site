  </p>
  
  <p>
    wore brown suede shoes and a diamond-studded cane<br />had a twelve-inch peg with a be-bop chain<br />now times turned hard and the weather grew cold<br />my old lady kicked my ass out said her love had grown old
  </p>
  
  <p>
    so I took me a walk down to rampart street<br />where all the bad motherfuckers are supposed tomeet<br />I walked through six inches a shit and ten inches a mud<br />to a place they call the bucket of blood
  </p>
  
  <p>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    he said &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of you down the way<br />I meet you raggedyass bastards damn near every day&#8221;<br />well the motherfucked never said much more<br />for one of my bullets laid the bastard dead on the floor
  </p>
  
  <p>
    a lady walked in said &#8220;oh god please&#8221;<br />I said &#8220;speak softly ma&#8217;am his mind is at ease&#8221;<br />she said &#8220;please don&#8217;t tell me my son is dead&#8221;<br />I said &#8220;if you don&#8217;t believe me cunt look at the hole in his head&#8221;
