    <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/map_image.pl-786026.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/map_image.pl-786026.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />was back in thirty-two when times were hard<br />I had a sawed-off shotgun and cold deck a cards<br />wore a brown squire suit and a big beaver hat<br />and if you motherfuckers ever saw me I was dressed like hat
  </p>
  
  <p>
    wore brown suede shoes and a diamond-studded cane<br />had a twelve-inch peg with a be-bop chain<br />now times turned hard and the weather grew cold<br />my old lady kicked my ass out said her love had grown old
  </p>
  
  <p>
    so I took me a walk down to rampart street<br />where all the bad motherfuckers are supposed tomeet<br />I walked through six inches a shit and ten inches a mud<br />to a place they call the bucket of blood
  </p>
  
  <p>
    called the bartender to give me a bite to eat<br />he gave me a muddy glass and a tough piece of meat<br />I say “say sonuvabitch don’t you know who I am?”<br />he said “frankly mister I don’t give a damn”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    he said “I’ve heard of you down the way<br />I meet you raggedyass bastards damn near every day”<br />well the motherfucked never said much more<br />for one of my bullets laid the bastard dead on the floor
  </p>
  
  <p>
    a lady walked in said “oh god please”<br />I said “speak softly ma’am his mind is at ease”<br />she said “please don’t tell me my son is dead”<br />I said “if you don’t believe me cunt look at the hole in his head”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    she said “I’ve heard of you you bastard your name is STACK<br />but you better not be here when billy lion get back”<br />“I’ll be here when the time comes and pass<br />and fuck your billy lion right dead in his ass”
  </p>
