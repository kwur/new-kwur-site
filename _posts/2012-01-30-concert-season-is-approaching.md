      YACHT: March 1 @ Plush &#8211; Last time I saw these guys they had a dance party with the entire crowd on stage, faked a video-chat in the middle of the show, and had a question and answer segment. Expect quirky dance music with plenty of crowd participation.

      Bass Drum of Death: March 2 @ The Old Rock House &#8211; Fun, loud garage rock. They played every song at double speed at their last show in St. Louis, making their set only 30 minutes long, but twice as exciting.

      Howler: March 9 @ The Old Rock House &#8211; If you didn't shell out the cash to go see Radiohead in St. Louis this night, you can catch Howler put on a show of summery surf rock.

      Distant Worlds with the St. Louis Symphony: March 23-24 @ Powell &#8211; St. Louis Symphony is playing the music from Final Fantasy. If you were a video game kid like me, this is exciting.
