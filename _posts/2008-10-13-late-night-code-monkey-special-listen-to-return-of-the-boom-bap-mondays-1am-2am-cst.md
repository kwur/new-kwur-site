  <p>
    I don’t write to the blog often. When I am, it’s usually to show off <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/megatrond">megatrond</a> on sourceforge, play up cool hardware upgrades (We just got new CD players – Tascam CD-O1U Pro ftw!) or <a href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/2008/04/from-archives-part-i-sample-interviews.html">archive old issues of Sample Magazine.</a> Tonight, I’m just coding the night away and bobbing my head to “Return of the Boom Bap” hosted by our very own <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thedapperdan">DJ Dapper Dan</a>.

    Alas, you’d never have to worry about missing “Return of the Boom Bap” if our contracts let us stream archived shows…
