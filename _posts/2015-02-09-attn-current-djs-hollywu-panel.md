    Hey deejs, here's a quick announcement via our very own Career Center for those of you interested in broadcasting. Check it out if you'd like to know more about jobs and internships in entertainment in LA.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      A group of enthusiastic young alumni who are employed in the entertainment space out in Los Angeles are working to further develop the Washington University community in the field via an initiative they are calling <strong><u>HollyWU</u></strong>.  Through HollyWU, these alumni are also very interested in mentoring and helping current students pursue entertainment career opportunities (jobs and internships) in LA. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      One of the first steps the newly formed group is taking is to host a virtual Google Hangout Information Session for current students.  Below you will find details on the session, along with the direct link for students to sign-up to participate.
