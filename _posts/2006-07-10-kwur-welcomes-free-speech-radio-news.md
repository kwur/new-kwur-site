  <p>
    KWUR is now one of 94 stations world wide to broadcast <a href="http://www.fsrn.org">Free Speech Radio News</a>. We are the only station in Missouri that currently broadcasts it. You can check it out every weekday (Mon-Fri) here on KWUR at 6pm CST.

    &#8220;Free Speech Radio News (FSRN) is an independent media organization that produces a 30-minute Monday-Friday radio newscast. With a network of over 200 freelance reporters around the world, FSRN serves over 100 radio stations and a growing cadre of Internet outlets. FSRN brings the world to the U.S. in first-hand reportage of every continent by independent reporters: coverage that CNN can only dream of. Our diversity of voices, in ethnicity, age and class, outstrips every other news organization and weâ€™re proud to be a progressive daily news outlet for those without Internet access. &#8220;

    [UPDATE: We will begin broadcasting FSRN once our Auto-Rotation program is updated. Should be pretty soon.]
