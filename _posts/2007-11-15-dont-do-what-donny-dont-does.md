    From my buddy over at Reed, ASCAP’s new effort to stem illegal downloading, Donny the Downloader:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The centerpiece of The Donny the Downloader Experience curriculum is a multi-media school assembly program featuring fast-paced animated videos starring the misadventures of Donny. Donny is a 14-year old who’s tech-savvy, but unaware of the bigger picture of why illegal downloading hurts the same performing artists and songwriters whose music he loves. The program centers on the negative reactions from the other kids and adults in his life who he tries to impress with his access to supposedly “free” music, while demystifying the process of how music is created.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In addition to the animated “Donny” segments, the assembly also features compelling video segments that introduce real-life, 17-year-old aspiring music creator, Sonya Bender. The videos follow Sonya as she meets with music creators, producers and publishers to get an unfiltered perspective on how illegally downloaded music negatively impacts their ability to make a living from being creative. The assembly experience also includes an interactive component, where students perform a special “Donny” skit to help reinforce what they’ve learned.

    Check out the <a href="http://www.ascap.com/resource/dtd">excerpt</a> here, it’s totally rad and stupid fresh. For a cogent counterpoint, here’s Simian Mobile Disco:<br /><br />In any case, a very interesting debate.
