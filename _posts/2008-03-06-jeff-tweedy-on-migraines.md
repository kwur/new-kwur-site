    The New York Times just posted a fascinating <a href="http://migraine.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/05/shaking-it-off/index.html">blog entry from Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy</a> on how migraines effected have effected his music. Itâ€™s really illuminating, and really helps to validate his latest album <span style="font-style: italic;">Sky Blue Sky</span> as a product of his recovery from both depression and addiction through its juxtaposition with his tumultuous pre-treatment album, <span style="font-style: italic;">A Ghost is Born.<br /><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span><br /></span>
