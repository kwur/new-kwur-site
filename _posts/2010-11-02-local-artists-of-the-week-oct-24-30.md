    <strong>Local New Releases<br /> US English – What Frontier EP</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This duo creates deep, warm, layered grooves from synths and sequencers augmented by both male and female vocals. Although the band clearly enjoys toying with their experimental tendencies, the songs never lose their catchiness. This is the first of a trio of EP releases, so we can look forward to much more from <a href="http://usenglishmusic.com/">US English</a>, who happen to be the same folks who work at the <a href="http://theluminaryarts.com/">Luminary Center for the Arts</a>.
