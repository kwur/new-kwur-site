    Hey folks,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Tune in for KWUR’s homemade debate coverage. We’ve got a panel of Washington University Political Review folks and special guests, and KWUR madmen broadcasting live from the madhouse of Spin Alley. Pre-debate stuff starts around 7, post-debate stuff starts when, you know, the debate ends (Flyer says 10, but think more 9:30).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Fact: Unlike Fox News, KWUR’s debate team has no convicted felons.
