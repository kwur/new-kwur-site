  <p>
    From Mr. Jazzface…
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “I just opened up my local newspaper and read about this weekend’s “CAVEFEST”, which is a festival held in a local saltpetre cave with country rock and “light metal” bands, including Facd Forward, Misfire, and Adam Tanas. Who is Adam Tanas? He is proudly a former member of the seminal <span style="font-weight: bold;">Krokus</span>! The festival also includes a bikini contest, which will probably be the best part of the weekend…”

  <p>
    That’s right folks, former member of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Krokus</span>. At KWUR we love Krokus. For those of you who are ignorant, <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:37d8vwmva9lk">check</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krokus_%28band%29">it</a> <a href="http://krokusonline.seven49.net/">out</a>.

    Thanks for the news Mr. Jazzface.

  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: I’ve never actually <span style="font-style: italic;">listened</span> to Krokus, but I like the <span style="font-style: italic;">idea</span> of Krokus.
