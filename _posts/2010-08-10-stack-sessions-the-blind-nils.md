  <p>
    St. Louis band <a href="http://www.myspace.com/theblindnils">the Blind Nils</a> joined us in the lounge at the station the other day for a short live performance on the air. They played 5 of their original tunes with eclectic instrumentation including banjo, slide guitar, and xylophone. Take a look the videos below for a peek into their set. Their entire set will be rebroadcast this Thursday at 3:30pm, so don’t forget to tune in at www.kwur.com.
