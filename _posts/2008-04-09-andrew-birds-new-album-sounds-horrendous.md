  <p>
    &#8220;The record I want to make here and now — the one I wish I could find in my local record store — is a gentle, lulling, polyrhythmic, minimalist yet warm tapestry of acoustic instruments. No solos, just interlocking parts. A little Steve Reich, but groovier. A little Ghanaian street music, but more arranged. Thick and creamy vocals like the Zombies’s Colin Blunstone. The bass warm and tubby like Studio One dub.&#8221;

    &#8230;but seriously, read <a href="http://measureformeasure.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/08/natural-history/index.html?hp">this</a>. It&#8217;s a great behind-the-scenes look at making an album.
