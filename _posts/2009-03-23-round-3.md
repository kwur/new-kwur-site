    <span style="font-style: italic;">I know at least one person is enjoying these, so here’s Round 3. For some reason, I happen to be posting 5 albums by MC duos (and also Jeru down there at the end).</span>

Great production by Buckwild and T-Ray, and Tame-One and El Da Sensei are sick as hell (particularly Tame). Definitely check out their second album, That’s Them (1997).<br />http://www.mediafire.com/?dywenn0dxk5

Coincidentally, as my brother once pointed out to me, this also has to be the lamest name for a hip-hop group of all time.<br />http://www.mediafire.com/?3nyywtmjdjk

Great production by Easy Mo Bee, and Drayz and Books rip up the mic as usual.<br />http://www.megaupload.com/?d=47EAUFU7

In recent years Monch has been wasting his talent by singing like quasi-R&B crap with a backing band, but don’t be fooled. The dude is unbelievable. The beats here are nothing special, but Monch and Prince Po are the best rhyming duo ever recorded.<br />http://www.mediafire.com/?9j0o5qegmmn

Ruck (Sean Price) and Rock (Rockness Monsta) are probably the best MCs in BCC, which is saying quite a bit. Just <span style="font-style: italic;">look</span> at those little guys hanging upside down. Love it.<br />http://www.megaupload.com/?d=KO5ZT51U

DJ Premier produced the entire album (as with Wrath of the Math, 1996), and it’s probably his finest work.<br />http://www.megaupload.com/?d=JFH800OC
