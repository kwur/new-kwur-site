    So I’m excited to announce that Shanks and I got to interview Dr. Drew on my show this Friday. We discussed Celebrity Rehab, college radio, and bestiality (oh Loveline). Thankfully, someone nabbed a recording of it (which I’m not entirely sure is legal) and I’ve made it available right here. Enjoy!
