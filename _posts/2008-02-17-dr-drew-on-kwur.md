    So I&#8217;m excited to announce that Shanks and I got to interview Dr. Drew on my show this Friday. We discussed Celebrity Rehab, college radio, and bestiality (oh Loveline). Thankfully, someone nabbed a recording of it (which I&#8217;m not entirely sure is legal) and I&#8217;ve made it available right here. Enjoy!

    It&#8217;s a big&#8217;un, but it&#8217;s worth it.
