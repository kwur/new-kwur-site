    I know that videos of famous musicians on Sesame Street get posted to death on music blogs, but they really do get some great artists on the show, from Johnny Cash to Andrew Bird to Stevie Wonder. I decided to take a trip down memory lane this morning and watch some of these videos, and one of my old favorites that I had long forgotten popped up on youtube.

    While Dolly Parton never actually appeared on Sesame Street, her Muppet spoof, Polly Darton, is dead on with a platinum blonde wig and huge bazoombas. Here she is with Benny Rabbit singing “14-Carrot Love.”
