    Hey there boys and girls in radioland, it's that time of year again &#8211; <strong>HUSTLE WEEK</strong>.&nbsp; That is to say, we're conducting our third annual fund drive/awareness week from November 29th through December 3rd.&nbsp; We've got a whole lot of exciting things lined up for you during that week, as evidenced by the schedule below.&nbsp; First, though, the basics:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>From November 29th to December 3rd KWUR is conducting its fundraising drive, Hustle Week. KWUR is run on a shoestring budget that has been dramatically cut twice in recent years and there is no guarantee that the budget will not be cut again in the future. In the past, fundraising dollars have been spent on essentials like shelves for the 45s and promotional schedule posters. If enough money is raised, it can be used to help pay for an improved KWUR Week, better equipment in the station or even music acquisitions. If you care about KWUR and appreciate the quality programming KWUR provides every day and you've got five or ten dollars to spare, we'd really appreciate any help you can give us.</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you'd like to donate, you can:<br /> 1) Stop by the station whenever there's a show and donate directly to a DJ.<br /> 2) Call in a pledge at (314) 935-5952 and mail a check made out to KWUR and your gift preference to:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    KWUR 90.3 FM<br /> Campus Box 1205<br /> One Brookings Dr.<br /> St. Louis, MO 63130
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We at KWUR would like to thank you for your donation and support through various gifts such as stack samplers, silk screened t-shirts, custom station IDs and even having a part of the station named after you.&nbsp; Gift-price list forthcoming, stay tuned.
