    <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/tadanoriyokoo-01-754702.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/tadanoriyokoo-01-754650.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Tadanori Yokoo is an internationally known graphic designer and poster artist. His work heavily draws upon pop-culture and he is sometimes unjustly labeled the &#8220;Japanese Andy Warhol.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In the 1960&#8217;s he became interested in mysticism and psychedelia, deepened by travels in India. His work shows it.

  <p>
    Below is his 1965 animated film, <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Kachi Kachi Yama</span>. It makes use of may pop icons of the 1960s from Bridget Bardot to the Beatles.

    For those interested, all 3 Yokoo animated films available (the above film and KISS KISS KISS (1964) & Tokuten Eizou Anthology NO. 1 (1964)) can be viewed/downloaded in one package at <a href="http://www.ubu.com/film/yokoo.html">Ubuweb</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Besides that, I can&#8217;t offer much more information. Very little background in English is available on Yokoo&#8217;s films. Either way, enjoy the films &#8211; they are completely visually stimulating.

    [Note: Experimental composer (and Yoko Ono&#8217;s first husband) Toshi Ichiyanagi&#8217;s work, &#8220;Opera from the Works of Tadanori Yokoo&#8221; was directly inspired by Yokoo&#8217;s artwork, who in a sense &#8220;Turned On&#8221; the composer. <a href="http://mutant-sounds.blogspot.com/2007/02/toshi-ichiyanagi-opera-from-works-of.html">This multimedia box</a>, a blend of musique concrete and psychedelic rock, is also definitely worth checking out]
