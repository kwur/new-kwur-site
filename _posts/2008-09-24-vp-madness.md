    Oh, it is catching. Please tune in to us (90.3 FM, www.kwur.com, channel 21 on your campus cable) or to WUTV (channel 22 on your campus cable) at 8 tomorrow to hear our contribution to the rabid election mania that is setting this campus ablaze. Our very own, David Rheinstrom, will be hosting the Warm Bucket Special, chatting it up about “what is VP?”, “Palin: O RLY?” and “Biden can has cheezburger?” with Professor Steven S. Smith, Kate M. Gregg Professor of Social Sciences, Professor of Political Science, and Director of the Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy and Greg Allen, the editor-in-chief of the Washington University Political Review.

    Fun fact: unlike MSNBC, no one on KWUR/WUTV’s election team is a half-crazed syphilitic.
