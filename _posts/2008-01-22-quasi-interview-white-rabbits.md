    Before last night’s show with White Denim and the Walkmen, I had a chance to talk with Alex Even, guitarist for the White Rabbits. While I didn’t have the chance to prepare for a more comprehensive interview, Alex was gracious enough to give me these little nuggets:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    On Columbia, MO: A great place to start a band. They were able to get all their embarrassing stuff out [of their system] there.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    On Wash U: He’s heard of it! Fond memories.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    On the band that will be the next White Rabbits: White Denim (When I asked the question, I was referring to another band from Columbia, but hey, White Denim was great, so no complaints here)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    On the Walkmen: “Inspiring”
