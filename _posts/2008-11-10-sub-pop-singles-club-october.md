    <p>
      Everyone&#8217;s favorite Seattle institution, Sub Pop records, re-established their well known singles club to celebrate their 20 anniversary. For $75, 1500 lucky subscribers will receive a special 7inch 45rpm record every month for one year. I&#8217;ll review them all right here on the KWUR Blog.

    The October 7inch was, in fact, not orange, but &#8220;McDonald&#8217;s yellow.&#8221; The single was by hip L.A. all-girl punk band, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mika Miko</span>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Sex Jazz (extended)&#8221; b/w &#8220;Bastard in Love&#8221;</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/sexjazz-750978.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 229px; height: 229px;" src="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/sexjazz-750968.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>This single is definitely my favorite of the three issued thus far. I liked it so much that I went and got <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">666</span>, the band&#8217;s single/live compilation.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The band is from the all-ages DIY scene revolving around The Smell, the same venue pictured on the cover of No Age&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">Weirdo Rippers</span>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The result is some raw lo-fi girl punk, and in my book, that can&#8217;t be beat. &#8220;Sex Jazz&#8221; is a dancy punk song from the outset. It starts with some pounding bass drum, thick bass, and some saxophone. Throw in some Gang of Four guitarwork and dry female vocals and you have a party.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;Bastard in Love&#8221; is not nearly as good, mostly a forgettable not-nearly-as-danceable song. However, this isn&#8217;t necessarily typical of the band, and <span style="font-style: italic;">666</span> is certainly worth checking out for a full dose of hip L.A. all-girl noise-punk.

    What will Sub Pop have in store for November?
