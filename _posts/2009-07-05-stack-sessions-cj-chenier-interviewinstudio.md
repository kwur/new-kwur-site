  <p>
    Zydeco legend CJ Chenier stopped by to play a few songs and chat with Zak before his show at Pop’s a few weeks ago. He brought along his <a href="http://www.montereyblues.com/assets/fs_chenier.jpg">ballin’ accordion</a> and a washboard player, and jammed out a few tunes on air. Check the whole interview <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=NNNWGVNZ">here</a></span>, and download/listen to the songs below.<br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=905KC4MY"><br />Louisiana Two-Step (live)</a><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=NEE7RY4A">You Don’t Need To Cry (live)</a><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=6OMCCF54">Got My Eyes On You (live)</a>

    oh ps we’re in the process of switching over to a new blog client, hopefully something that will take megaupload out of the equation and let us host audio in-house. stay tuned for details as they unfold!
