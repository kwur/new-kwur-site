    We're still a 10 watt station. In our current situation, our terrestrial signal won't ever come close to reaching a vast majority of St. Louisians' radios. But we recently took an enermous step towards improving our broadcast signal, and consequently, towards reintegrating ourselves into the counsciousness of our close neighbors in the St. Louis community.

    With the generous help of radio mogul Sam Caputa, we installed a new transmitter to replace our old one &#8211; a beloved, but decrepit unit that was barely spitting out 5-10% of our legally allocated power. You may have noticed the degrading signal over the course of the past few years. It was a result of many factors, but the most fundamental problem was the old transmitter. With the new transmitter, KWUR is excited to be broadcasting throughout University City, Clayton, the Central West End, and other nearby areas. We've got some more (small and large scale) signal-improving plans on the docket, so this area may expand when we work through those.

    Take this new opportunity to support terrestrial, free-form, autonomous, student-run, community radio! Tune in and find some weekly programs that strike your fancy. Keep checking back on the site (and the <a href="https://twitter.com/KWUR">KWUR twitter</a>) for announcements about exciting happenings on our airwaves and in the community. And let us know when you like something you hear! Comment on the blog, tweet us, or talk to the DJ! The studio line is (314) 935-5987. We are inspired and propelled by the knowledge that others, especially strangers, enjoy what we do. I recently read a quote by the author Robert Walser (originally referring to something completely unrelated to radio) that reminded me of this feature &#8211; the combination of anonymity and intimacy &#8211; that terrestrial community radio provides.
