    <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/eliot-spitzer-sad-746095.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 319px; height: 320px;" src="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/eliot-spitzer-sad-746074.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Freeform favorites, <a href="http://www.wfmu.org">WFMU</a>, finally launched their <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Free Music Archive</span></a> site. Think of it as a hip Archive.org audio section built on newer web technology.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    All the music on the site is easily searchable, streamable, and downloadable for your pleasure. More importantly (like archive.org), all the music is licensed under the Creative Commons. Therefore, you can download it freely, use it non-commercially, and in some cases, modify the music and share it also.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is good &#8217;cause WFMU now regularly posts in-studio appearances and sponsored live shows. Additionally, they&#8217;ve partnered up with a bunch of other like-minded media outlets (KEXP, KBOO, dublab) who are curating their own sections. Maybe KWUR should look into getting in on this&#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To get into the spirit, I highly recommend starting off with this <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Thee_Oh_Sees/Live_at_The_Bell_House_442009/">live Oh Sees recording</a> from the site launch party which was last Saturday.

    Also highly recommended are <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/WFMU/WFMUs_Free_Music_Archive_sampler">two</a> <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/WFMU/WFMUs_Free_Music_Archive_Sampler_Vol_2">volumes</a> of &#8220;WFMU&#8217;s Free Music Archive Sampler&#8221; put out last year as a little pre-launch site preview.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Finally, you can thank former New York governer Eliot Spitzer and the New York State Music Fund for providing grant money to seed this operation&#8230;
