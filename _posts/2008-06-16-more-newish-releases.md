    some little reviews
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Riders in the Sky &#8211; Public Cowboy #1: A Centennial Salute to the Music of Gene Autry (Rounder)</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Cowboy song semi-spoofers Riders in the SKy recorded this tribute to the original singin&#8217; cowboy for his 100th birthday in 1996 &#8211; this is a reissue. They tend to tread the same tricky line Mr. Autry (with all due respect) himself did&#8211; between country music and Hollywood cowboy schmaltz. Great choice of tunes, though the slick pop Western Swing production might scare off many KWUR DJs (naturally that&#8217;s my favorite part of the album). Think West Coast W. Swing on that account (Spade Cooley, et cetera).<br />I dig &#8220;The Last Roundup,&#8221; &#8220;Tumbling Tumbleweeds,&#8221; &#8220;Have I Told You Lately That I Love You?&#8221; others&#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Hungrytown &#8211; s/t (Listen Here! Records)<br /></span><br />Unremarkable earnest folk with country signifiers in the arrangements (fiddle, banjo, close, sharp harmonies). I would probably love this were it not for the bland, flat, unemotive vocals. As it is, this aspect overwhelms the pleasant pickin&#8217;, alright tunes. One or two solid numbers with thicker background vocals merit keeping it (and who knows it may be someone else&#8217;s bag).<br />I dig &#8220;On the Other Side&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Drakkar Sauna &#8211; Wars and Tornadoes: Drakkar Sauna Faithfully Sing the Songs of the Louvin Brothers (Marriage Records)</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Lawrence, Kansas-based trad country duo extremely faithfully recreate these representative tunes from one of the all-time best country duos (one of the famous &#8220;brother duos,&#8221; along with the Delmore Bros). Their approximation of the harmonies is especially remarkable (Ira and Charlie were famous for their off-kilter harmonies and the late Ira possessed a glass-shattering high-lonesome tenor). All of these are wonderful renditions of some of the best tunes out there, so I couldn&#8217;t recommend them enough, at least until we get some of the originals here in the stacks. Check &#8217;em out! As for the Louvins, I recommend &#8220;A Tribute to the Delmore Brothers&#8221; and the infamous &#8220;Satan is Real.&#8221; Also, Charlie L is still alive and kicking so go see him while you still can (saw him last year for free at fucking Vintage Vinyl and it was honestly transcendant). <br />I dig &#8217;em all, especially &#8220;When I Stop Dreaming&#8221; (an old favorite)

    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Alejandro Escovedo &#8211; Real Animal (Blue Note)</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Escovedo&#8217;s a veteran of 1st wave 70&#8217;s punk, 80&#8217;s-90&#8217;s alt.country/&#8221;cowpunk,&#8221; lots of other short-lived scenes&#8230; His acclaimed solo albums have been a nice mishmash of country/folk, tejano and hard rock. This album though (following his somber previous &#8220;The Boxing Mirror,&#8221; recorded when he thought he was gonna die from Hep C), is clearly a Straight Rock Album, full of anthemic, radio-friendly, arena rock. Don&#8217;t assume it&#8217;s brainless &#8211; Escovedo&#8217;s a literate and precise songwriter (these tunes are full of poetic images and shit, sure to set your heart a flutter). Basically I respect that this is unabashed pop music (as with all my, like, most favorite music), but I have a hard time wading through cocks-out stadium rock w/meaty choruses and big drums. ok.<br />I dig &#8220;Nuns Song,&#8221; &#8220;Real as an Animal,&#8221; &#8220;Hollywood Hills&#8221;

    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Jim White &#8211; Transnormal Skiperoo (Luaka Bop)</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    White has staked himself a nice little lyrical territory steeped in southern gothic, mythic mumbo jumbo. At times he veers into caricature, self-parody and pastiche, but he can also write some earnest, affecting tunes. This time around, he&#8217;s apparently digging some country gospel, classic R&b and droney swamp blues vibes. Too many bland, hookless &#8220;atmosphere&#8221; numbers (what is it with that shit these days?). <br />I dig &#8220;Turquoise House,&#8221; &#8220;Jailbird&#8221;
