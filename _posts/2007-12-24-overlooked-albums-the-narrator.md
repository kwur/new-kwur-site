  <p>
    &#8220;SurfJew&#8221; is one of the best songs of the year. Better than anything off <span style="font-style: italic;">Strawberry Jam</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Neon Bible</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer?</span>. It is the lead single off of The Narrator&#8217;s sophomore album, <span style="font-style: italic;">All That to the Wall</span>. This album was overlooked for two main reasons. First, it was released around the same time as the new albums from Kings of Leon, Arctic Monkeys, Voxtrot, and the National. And second, it sounds a lot like a raw version of Pavement. It&#8217;s safe to say that <span style="font-style: italic;">All That to the Wall</span> isn&#8217;t as good as an album like <span style="font-style: italic;">Slanted and Enchanted</span>, but the album is still criminally underappreciated. The rawness is enchanting, especially when some albums are so overproduced (I&#8217;m looking at you, Voxtrot). But the album is produced just enough to bring out how insanely catchy the songs are, and there&#8217;s a real honest quality to it also. Come on, how can you not like a song about a black hole bar mitzvah?
