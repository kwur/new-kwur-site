Sure, he&#8217;s moving out to L.A. to take over the Tonight Show (starting June 2), but I&#8217;ll still miss him in the 12:30 slot. I&#8217;m confident Conan will bring his own style to the Tonight Show (which far surpasses the mediocrity of Jay Leno), but it won&#8217;t be the same (i.e. I wouldn&#8217;t expect the &#8220;Masturbating Bear&#8221; to make an appearance&#8230;).

    I&#8217;ve been watching his show for over 10 years now (and I hate TV), so it&#8217;s been a lot of fun watching these last batch of shows full of old clips and unannounced guests. Conan favorites <span style="font-weight: bold;">The White Stripes</span> will be the music guest for tonight&#8217;s last show, but who else will show up? (I hope Andy Richter makes an appearance&#8230;)

    And here&#8217;s my favorite reoccurring Conan skit, &#8220;The Interrupter&#8221;&#8230;<br />
