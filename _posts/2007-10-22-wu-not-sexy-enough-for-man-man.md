    Pardon my nostalgia, but after a conversation last night with Chris Ward of fellow Philly band Pattern is Movement, I just had to track down this article.

    Man, do my arms hurt. We woke up at 8 this morning to shuffle equipment out of Shape Shoppe and into a van, drive several hours to a college show in St. Louis, and finally unload all this shit into what looks like a school cafeteria without the tables. This is but a day in a life of a band without a tour manager or roadies. I can only imagine what a two-month tour is like.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A sample of the things we moved to the tune of the sun-baked solo album from Animal Collective&#8217;s Panda Bear: a complete drum kit, numerous cases overstuffed with noisemakers and things to bang on, guitars, overnight bags, pillows, blankets, keyboard coffins, a milk crate for me to sit on, Christmas lights for ambience, and, finally, Kattner&#8217;s massive, might-as-well-be-a-grand-piano synthesizer, which elicited the comment, &#8220;This is why I always ask myself why I haven&#8217;t gone digital.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    All of it Ã¢â‚¬â€ the loss of breath, the profuse sweating despite it being 20 degrees outside, the &#8220;I-swear-I-didn&#8217;t-drop-that-synthesizer!&#8221; Ã¢â‚¬â€ was worth it. It always is, at least when it leads to a great show amid terrible sound and a sexless crowd. Which is exactly how tonight&#8217;s Washington University gig went despite the degree of smashing, shrieking, leaping and convulsing that went into fan favorites like &#8220;Zebra,&#8221; &#8220;English Bwudd&#8221; and &#8220;Push the Eagle&#8217;s Stomach&#8221; and such still-developing new songs as &#8220;Spooky Jookie,&#8221; &#8220;Top Drawer&#8221; and &#8220;Hurly Burly.&#8221; (The only new jam that fell flat was a bizarre, live drum and bass interlude called &#8220;El Azteca.&#8221; And that&#8217;s only because the thing sounds inhuman on record.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There&#8217;s a so-horrible-it&#8217;s-awesome frat row scene unfolding before us now. Not one to avoid their (hundred or so) adoring fans, Kattner, Dufala, fellow multi-instrumentalist Russell Higbee (aka Alejandro &#8220;Cougar&#8221; Bord) and Kattner&#8217;s dad have decided to follow the flier handed to them by a few nervous college radio kids to an off-campus kegger.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In one corner: a stack of premium day-old bagels and a hookah pumping out sweet-smelling tobacco. (Apparently no one here felt like springing for pot; oh, wait, no, that&#8217;s happening in the back room, where &#8220;the trees are at,&#8221; according to one future Volkswagen driver.) In another: a giddy DJ spinning dated dance music on turntables and a laptop. Did I mention he&#8217;s also controlling a friggin&#8217;fog machine?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;This brings me back,&#8221; says Gary Kattner Ã¢â‚¬â€ think a slimmer, taller version of Ryan with a slight Texas drawl Ã¢â‚¬â€ as we raise plastic cups of nondescript beer. I smile and suck down foam but can&#8217;t help feeling like Bluto in Animal House.
