  </p>
  
  <p>
    Case in point #1: <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Fantasia</span>, 1940
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Fantasia</span> broke all the barriers. It not only challenged the visual potential (in Technicolorâ„¢!) of large scale animation motion pictures, but it heavily experimented with the possibilities of pairing classical music (in stereo!) with animation.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In fact, Disney sunk so much money into the project that it took 6 releases before the film turned a profit.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It is no coincidence that it was the 1969 re-release that finally made the film profitable. Since the film became popular among users of marijuana and LSD, Disney was able to re-brand Fantasia as a &#8220;Trip Film&#8221;. The campaign was successful, as the youth flocked to the theaters (high or not) to experience this masterpiece.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The film not only captured the psychedelic look 25 years before the popularization of LSD, but it also became the first music video (film).<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/Fantasia002-730117.png"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 220px; height: 172px;" src="http://www.kwur.com/blog/uploaded_images/Fantasia002-730106.png" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />There have been many edits to Fantasia because of racial stereotypes, sound/picture presentation, and length. The version that is closest to the original release version is the 60th Anniversary <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fantasia-Special-Anniversary-Leopold-Stokowski/dp/B00003CX9W/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-2489089-5812752?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1193025357&sr=8-1">DVD</a> released in 2000. Just don&#8217;t bug out during the &#8220;Night on Bald Mountain&#8221; sequence.
